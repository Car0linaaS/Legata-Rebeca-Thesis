============= COMPLETE LLM OUTPUT =============
Here is the **Rebeca property file** that represents the Legata clause `COLREG.Rule19.b`, including variable definitions and assertions based on the described semantics:

### ✅ **Rebeca Property File**

```rebeca
property{
	define {
		ship1NotInSight = (!theMap.ships_close_to_each_other);
		ship2NotInSight = (!theMap.ships_close_to_each_other);

		ship1InRestrictedVisibility = s1.restricted_visibility;
		ship2InRestrictedVisibility = s2.restricted_visibility;

		ship1IsPowerDriven = s1.vessel_type_powerdriven;
		ship2IsPowerDriven = s2.vessel_type_powerdriven;

		ship1SafeSpeed = (s1.ship_velocity <= theMap.speed_safe_range);
		ship2SafeSpeed = (s2.ship_velocity <= theMap.speed_safe_range);

		ship1EngineOn = s1.engine_on;
		ship2EngineOn = s2.engine_on;
	}

	Assertion {
		ship1Rule19b: (!(ship1NotInSight && ship1InRestrictedVisibility && ship1IsPowerDriven && ship1SafeSpeed) || ship1EngineOn);
		ship2Rule19b: (!(ship2NotInSight && ship2InRestrictedVisibility && ship2IsPowerDriven && ship2SafeSpeed) || ship2EngineOn);
	}
}
```

### 🔍 **Explanation of the Semantics and Mapping**

#### **Legata Clause Summary (`COLREG.Rule19.b`):**

* This clause applies when a power-driven vessel is **not in sight of another** and is **in or near an area of restricted visibility**.
* Under those conditions, the vessel must:

  1. **Proceed at a safe speed**, and
  2. **Have engines ready for immediate maneuvering** (i.e., engine should be ON).

### 🧩 **Mapping of Legata to Rebeca**

| **Legata Concept**                            | **Mapped Rebeca Expression**                  | **Explanation**                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `(OS, TS).Visible is true`                    | `!theMap.ships_close_to_each_other`           | Ships not in sight is interpreted as *not being close* (assumed proxy for visibility). |
| `OS.Position in RestrictedVisibility Area`    | `s1.restricted_visibility`                    | `restricted_visibility` is a boolean state var in `Ship`.                              |
| `OS.Type is Vessel.Type.PowerDriven`          | `s1.vessel_type_powerdriven`                  | Explicit boolean for type check.                                                       |
| `OS.Speed in RestrictedVisibility.Safe.Range` | `s1.ship_velocity <= theMap.speed_safe_range` | `speed_safe_range` defines max allowed velocity in restricted visibility.              |
| `OS.Engine.State in ['Vessel.Engine.ON']`     | `s1.engine_on`                                | Engine ON is directly mapped as a boolean.                                             |

### ✅ **Assertion Semantics**

* The assertion logic follows the format:

  ```
  if (preconditions are all true) then (engine must be on)
  ```
* Since implications (`->`) are not allowed, the format used is:

  ```
  !Preconditions || Consequence
  ```

This ensures the clause is **only enforced when applicable**, and the system allows flexibility outside those conditions.

Would you like a version of this for more than two ships or additional COLREG rules?

============= CRITERIA EVALUATION =============
Total points: 7/9

1. Is the syntax correct, so that we can run the proposed Rebeca property, without changes? (Yes=1p, No=0p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 1p

2. Are all relevant attributes included? (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p) (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 3p

Attributes:
Ship: [exists for ship1] [exists for ship2]
Restricted_visibility ✅✅
Vessel_type_powerdriven ✅✅
Ship_velocity ✅✅
engine_on ✅✅

theMap:
Speed_safe_range ✅✅
Ships_close ✅

3. Are correctness properties created for all relevant actors? (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor) (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor)
Answer: Yes
Points: 2p

4. Is the output code free from hallucinations (e.g. any irrelevant code added)? (1p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 1p

5. Is the logic correct? (2p (Full expression: 1p, Correct: 1p) )
Answer: Not correct, not full expression
Points: 0p

(!(!A && B && D && E) || F)
Note: It misinterpreted ships_close_to_each_other as "not in sight of each other", which makes the assertion
not working. We use ships_close_to_each_other for proximity, and restricted_visibility for bad visibility
It also did not include ship2 for restricted_visibility when checking ship_1 and vice versa, which means
that one ship may have too high speed even though there is another ship nearby it doesn't see
