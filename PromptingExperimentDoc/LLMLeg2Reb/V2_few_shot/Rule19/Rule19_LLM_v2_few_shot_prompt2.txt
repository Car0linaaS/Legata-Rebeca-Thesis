### ✅ **Rebeca Property File**

```rebeca
property {
	define {
		ship1IsPowerDriven = s1.vessel_type_powerdriven;
		ship2IsPowerDriven = s2.vessel_type_powerdriven;

		ship1SpeedSafe = (s1.ship_velocity <= theMap.speed_safe_range);
		ship2SpeedSafe = (s2.ship_velocity <= theMap.speed_safe_range);

		ship1InRestrictedVisibility = s1.restricted_visibility;
		ship2InRestrictedVisibility = s2.restricted_visibility;

		ship1EngineOn = s1.engine_on;
		ship2EngineOn = s2.engine_on;
	}

	Assertion {
		ship1rule19b: (!ship1InRestrictedVisibility || !ship1IsPowerDriven || !ship1SpeedSafe || ship1EngineOn);
		ship2rule19b: (!ship2InRestrictedVisibility || !ship2IsPowerDriven || !ship2SpeedSafe || ship2EngineOn);
	}
}
```

### 🔍 **Explanation of Semantics and Mapping**

#### 🔹 **Semantic Meaning of the Legata Clause `COLREG.Rule19.b`**:

This clause enforces specific requirements when a **power-driven vessel** is navigating under **restricted visibility conditions**:

1. The ship must proceed at a **safe speed** suitable for the visibility and environmental conditions.
2. Its **engine must be ready**, i.e., turned **ON**, for immediate maneuvering.

#### 🔹 **Breakdown of Legata Clause and Its Mapping in Rebeca**:

| Legata Element                                                   | Rebeca Mapping                                               | Explanation                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OS.Type is Vessel.Type.PowerDriven`                             | `ship1IsPowerDriven`, `ship2IsPowerDriven`                   | The vessel is power-driven.                                         |
| `OS.Speed in Vessel.RestrictedVisibility.Speed.Safe.Range`       | `ship1SpeedSafe`, `ship2SpeedSafe`                           | Ship’s speed is within the safe limit during restricted visibility. |
| `OS.Engine.State in ['Vessel.Engine.ON']`                        | `ship1EngineOn`, `ship2EngineOn`                             | The ship's engine must be ON.                                       |
| `OS.Restriction in ['COLREG.Rule19.*']` (implied restricted vis) | `ship1InRestrictedVisibility`, `ship2InRestrictedVisibility` | Indicates if the ship is under restricted visibility.               |

#### 🔹 **Assertion Explanation**:

* The assertion uses **guarded compliance logic**:

  * If the ship is **not in restricted visibility**, then the rule doesn't apply — assertion holds.
  * If the ship is **not power-driven**, rule doesn't apply.
  * If the ship is **not within safe speed**, rule doesn't apply.
  * But if **all three apply**, then the **engine must be ON**, otherwise the assertion fails.

Would you like me to also convert the full Rule 19 clause, including part (a), into a corresponding Rebeca property file?

============= CRITERIA EVALUATION =============
Total points: 6/9

1. Is the syntax correct, so that we can run the proposed Rebeca property, without changes? (Yes=1p, No=0p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 1p

2. Are all relevant attributes included? (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p) (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p)
Answer: No
Points: 2p

Attributes:
Ship: [exists for ship1] [exists for ship2]
Restricted_visibility ✅✅
Vessel_type_powerdriven ✅✅
Ship_velocity ✅✅
engine_on ✅✅

theMap:
Speed_safe_range ✅✅
Ships_close ❌

3. Are correctness properties created for all relevant actors? (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor) (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor)
Answer: Yes
Points: 2p

4. Is the output code free from hallucinations (e.g. any irrelevant code added)? (1p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 1p

5. Is the logic correct? (2p (Full expression: 1p, Correct: 1p))
Answer: Not full expression, Not correct 
Points: 0p

Note: Giving semicorrect results from its logic
(!B || !D || !E || F)
Note: Does not check whether ship is close to the other ship
