### ✅ **Rebeca Property File**

```rebeca
property{
	define {
		ship1PowerDriven = s1.vessel_type_powerdriven;
		ship2PowerDriven = s2.vessel_type_powerdriven;

		ship1SafeSpeedInRestrictedVisibility = (s1.ship_velocity <= theMap.speed_safe_range);
		ship2SafeSpeedInRestrictedVisibility = (s2.ship_velocity <= theMap.speed_safe_range);

		ship1EngineReady = s1.engine_on;
		ship2EngineReady = s2.engine_on;

		ship1InRestrictedVisibility = s1.restricted_visibility;
		ship2InRestrictedVisibility = s2.restricted_visibility;
	}

	Assertion {
		ship1Rule19b: (!ship1InRestrictedVisibility || !ship1PowerDriven || !ship1SafeSpeedInRestrictedVisibility || ship1EngineReady);
		ship2Rule19b: (!ship2InRestrictedVisibility || !ship2PowerDriven || !ship2SafeSpeedInRestrictedVisibility || ship2EngineReady);
	}
}

### 📘 **Semantic Meaning of the Legata Clause**

#### Clause Summary:

The Legata clause `COLREG.Rule19.b` applies to vessels in or near areas of **restricted visibility**, particularly when they **are not in sight of one another** (Rule 19 context). The clause mandates that:

1. **All vessels** must proceed at a **safe speed** adapted to the restricted visibility conditions.
2. If the vessel is **power-driven**, its **engines must be ready** for immediate maneuvering.

#### Behavioral Rule:

* If a **power-driven** vessel is navigating in **restricted visibility** and is proceeding at a **safe speed**, then it must **have its engine on**.
* Otherwise, the rule is not triggered or is trivially satisfied (e.g., if visibility is clear, or the vessel is not power-driven).

### 🔄 **Mapping of Legata Elements to Rebeca Variables**

| **Legata Clause Attribute**                                           | **Mapped Rebeca Property Variable**                        |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OS.Type is Vessel.Type.PowerDriven`                                  | `s1.vessel_type_powerdriven`, `s2.vessel_type_powerdriven` |
| `OS.Speed in Vessel.RestrictedVisibility.Speed.Safe.Range`            | `s1.ship_velocity <= theMap.speed_safe_range`              |
| `OS.Engine.State in ['Vessel.Engine.ON']`                             | `s1.engine_on`, `s2.engine_on`                             |
| `OS.Restriction in ['COLREG.Rule19.*']` (or in restricted visibility) | `s1.restricted_visibility`, `s2.restricted_visibility`     |

Note: The `ship1InRestrictedVisibility` acts as the enabling condition simulating the "clause applies in restricted visibility" context.

============= CRITERIA EVALUATION =============
Total points: 7/10

1. Is the syntax correct, so that we can run the proposed Rebeca property, without changes? (Yes=1p, No=0p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 1p

2. Are all relevant attributes included? (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p) (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p)
Answer: No
Points: 2p

Attributes:
Ship: [exists for ship1] [exists for ship2]
Restricted_visibility ✅✅
Vessel_type_powerdriven ✅✅
Ship_velocity ✅✅
engine_on ✅✅

theMap:
Speed_safe_range ✅✅
Ships_close❌

3. Are correctness properties created for all relevant actors? (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor) (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor)
Answer: Yes
Points: 2p

4. Is the output code free from hallucinations (e.g. any irrelevant code added)? (1p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 1p

5. Is the logic correct? (3p (Correct: 2p, Partially correct: 1p) + (Full expression:1p))
Answer: Partially correct, not full expression
Points: 1p

Note: Giving semicorrect results from its logic
(!B || !D || !E || F)
Note: Does not check whether ship is close to the other ship
