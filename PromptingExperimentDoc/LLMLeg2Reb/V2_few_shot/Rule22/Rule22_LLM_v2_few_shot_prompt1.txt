### âœ… Rebeca Property File Representation:

```rebeca
property {
	define {
		ship1isOver50m = s1.ship_length > 50;
		ship1mastheadLightVisible = s1.masthead_light_range >= 6;
		ship1sideLightVisible = s1.side_light_range >= 3;
		ship1sternLightVisible = s1.stern_light_range >= 3;
		ship1towingLightVisible = s1.towing_light_range >= 3;
		ship1signalLightVisible = s1.signal_light_range >= 3;

		ship2isOver50m = s2.ship_length > 50;
		ship2mastheadLightVisible = s2.masthead_light_range >= 6;
		ship2sideLightVisible = s2.side_light_range >= 3;
		ship2sternLightVisible = s2.stern_light_range >= 3;
		ship2towingLightVisible = s2.towing_light_range >= 3;
		ship2signalLightVisible = s2.signal_light_range >= 3;
	}

	Assertion {
		s1LightVisibilityCompliance: !ship1isOver50m || (ship1mastheadLightVisible && ship1sideLightVisible && ship1sternLightVisible && ship1towingLightVisible && ship1signalLightVisible);
		s2LightVisibilityCompliance: !ship2isOver50m || (ship2mastheadLightVisible && ship2sideLightVisible && ship2sternLightVisible && ship2towingLightVisible && ship2signalLightVisible);
	}
}
```

### ðŸ’¡ Semantic Meaning of the Legata Clause:

The Legata clause `COLREG.Rule22.a` enforces light visibility requirements for vessels **50 meters or longer**. According to COLREG (Rule 22, Annex I), the following navigational lights must meet **minimum visibility ranges**:

* **Masthead Light**: visible at **â‰¥ 6 miles**
* **Side Light, Stern Light, Towing Light, All-Round Light (Signal Light)**: visible at **â‰¥ 3 miles**

### ðŸ”„ Mapping Explanation (Legata â†’ Rebeca):

| Legata Expression                              | Rebeca Equivalent Variable                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OS.Length > meters(50)`                       | `ship1isOver50m = s1.ship_length > 50`                     |
| `OS.Equipment.MastheadLight.Range >= miles(6)` | `ship1mastheadLightVisible = s1.masthead_light_range >= 6` |
| `OS.Equipment.SideLight.Range >= miles(3)`     | `ship1sideLightVisible = s1.side_light_range >= 3`         |
| `OS.Equipment.SternLight.Range >= miles(3)`    | `ship1sternLightVisible = s1.stern_light_range >= 3`       |
| `OS.Equipment.TowingLight.Range >= miles(3)`   | `ship1towingLightVisible = s1.towing_light_range >= 3`     |
| `OS.Equipment.SignalLight.Range >= miles(3)`   | `ship1signalLightVisible = s1.signal_light_range >= 3`     |

The assertions check that **if a ship is over 50 meters**, then **all required light visibility conditions are satisfied**. If the ship is under 50 meters, then the rule does not apply (the assertion passes by default).
