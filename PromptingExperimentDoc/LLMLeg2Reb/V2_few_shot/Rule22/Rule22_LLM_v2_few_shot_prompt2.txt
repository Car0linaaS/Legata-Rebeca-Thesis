### ðŸ“˜ Explanation of Semantics

**Legata Clause Meaning:**
The clause `COLREG.Rule22.a` enforces **minimum visibility ranges** for navigation lights on vessels that are **50 meters or more in length**. These requirements ensure visibility to other ships to avoid collisions, especially at night or in poor visibility.

**Mapping of Legata to Rebeca:**

| Legata Expression                        | Rebeca Variable                    | Explanation                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `OS.Length > meters(50)`                 | `ship1isOver50m`, `ship2isOver50m` | Checks if the vessel length is over 50 meters                |
| `OS.Equipment.MastheadLight.Range >= 6`  | `ship1mastheadLightVisible` etc.   | Ensures masthead light has at least 6 miles visibility       |
| `... >= 3` (Side, Stern, Towing, Signal) | `... >= 3` for each ship           | Ensures each specified light has at least 3 miles visibility |

**Assertion Logic:**

* If a ship is not over 50 meters (`!ship1isOver50m`), the requirement doesnâ€™t apply.
* If it **is** over 50 meters, then **all** light ranges must meet or exceed the regulation values.
* Logical OR (`||`) and AND (`&&`) are used to represent this: "If condition, then requirements" is represented as `!condition || requirements`.

============= CRITERIA EVALUATION =============
Total points: 10/9

1. Is the syntax correct, so that we can run the proposed Rebeca property, without changes? (Yes=1p, No=0p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 1p

2. Are all relevant attributes included? (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p) (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 3p

Attributes:
Ship: [exists for ship]
ship_length âœ…
masthead_light_range âœ…
side_light_range âœ…
stern_light_range âœ…
towing_light_range âœ…
signal_light_range âœ…

Note: We also checked that the light exist, which shouldn't be needed if the light has a range
masthead_light
side_light
stern_light
towing_light
signal_light

3. Are correctness properties created for all relevant actors? (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor) (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor)
Answer: Yes
Points: 2p

4. Is the output code free from hallucinations (e.g. any irrelevant code added)? (1p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 1p

5. Is the logic correct? (2p (Full expression: 1p, Correct: 1p) )
Answer: Correct, Full expression 
Points: 3p
