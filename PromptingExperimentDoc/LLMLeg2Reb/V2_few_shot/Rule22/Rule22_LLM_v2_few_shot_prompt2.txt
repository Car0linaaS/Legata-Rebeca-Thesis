### ðŸ“˜ Explanation of Semantics

**Legata Clause Meaning:**
The clause `COLREG.Rule22.a` enforces **minimum visibility ranges** for navigation lights on vessels that are **50 meters or more in length**. These requirements ensure visibility to other ships to avoid collisions, especially at night or in poor visibility.

**Mapping of Legata to Rebeca:**

| Legata Expression                        | Rebeca Variable                    | Explanation                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `OS.Length > meters(50)`                 | `ship1isOver50m`, `ship2isOver50m` | Checks if the vessel length is over 50 meters                |
| `OS.Equipment.MastheadLight.Range >= 6`  | `ship1mastheadLightVisible` etc.   | Ensures masthead light has at least 6 miles visibility       |
| `... >= 3` (Side, Stern, Towing, Signal) | `... >= 3` for each ship           | Ensures each specified light has at least 3 miles visibility |

**Assertion Logic:**

* If a ship is not over 50 meters (`!ship1isOver50m`), the requirement doesnâ€™t apply.
* If it **is** over 50 meters, then **all** light ranges must meet or exceed the regulation values.
* Logical OR (`||`) and AND (`&&`) are used to represent this: "If condition, then requirements" is represented as `!condition || requirements`.
