Context: Legata is a domain language that describes abstract legal concepts regarding COLREG (Collision Regulations). In Legata there are various clauses that describe different laws and regulations that vessels must adhere to. These clauses are intended for modeling regulatory compliance and simulation of maritime scenarios.
The structure of a clause is as follows:

clause['NameOfClause']:{
condition: {
: Condition1
: Condition2
}
assure: {
: BooleanExpression
}
}

Timed Rebeca (Reactive Objects Language) is used for modeling and simulating concurrent, reactive systems. The code below is part of a model used to simulate vessels, created in Timed Rebeca. 
The relevant actors are Ship s1, Ship s2 and MapServer theMap. The actors are modeled like this:

reactiveclass Ship(50) {
	knownrebecs {
		MapServer theMap;
	}
	statevars{
		int ship_length;
		boolean vessel_type_powerdriven;
		boolean underway;

		boolean masthead_forward_light_on;
        boolean masthead_abaft_light_on;
		boolean side_light_on;
		boolean stern_light_on;
		boolean allround_light_on;
	}

reactiveclass MapServer(50) {
	knownrebecs{
		Ship s1;
		Ship s2;
	}
	statevars{
	}

The property file is constructed like this:
property{
	define {
    Variable = (BooleanExpression);
	}

	Assertion {
        AssertionName: (BooleanExpression);
	}
}

Example:

Legata clause:
# Description: Istanbul Strait protocols
# File: strait.legata
define: {
OS: OwnShip # Convenience macro definitions
}
# (3) Check if the sea current exceeds 4 kn, then large
# vessels, deep-draught vessels and hazardous cargocarrying
# vessels with a speed of 10 kn or less cannot
# enter the strait.

clause['Istanbul.Strait.Rule3.LargeVessel']:{
    : {
        condition: { 
        :(OS.Length > meters(150)) and (OS.Undercurrent > kn(4))
	    :(OS.Draught > meters(10)) and (OS.Undercurrent > kn(4))
        }
        assure: { 
            :OS.Velocity > kn(10)
        }
    }
}

Corresponding Rebeca property file:
property{
	define {
		undercurrentsAboveLimit = theMap.undercurrent > 4;
		ship1InsideIstanbulStrait = theMap.ship1_inside_istanbul_strait;
		ship1isOverLengthLimit = s1.ship_length > 150;
		ship1isOverDraughtLimit = s1.ship_draught > 10;
		ship1isFastEnough = s1.ship_velocity > 10;
		
		ship2InsideIstanbulStrait = theMap.ship2_inside_istanbul_strait;
		ship2isOverLengthLimit = s2.ship_length > 150;
		ship2isOverDraughtLimit = s2.ship_draught > 10;
		ship2isFastEnough = s2.ship_velocity > 10;
	}
	Assertion {
		s1LargeVesselB1: !ship1InsideIstanbulStrait || ship1isFastEnough || !undercurrentsAboveLimit || !(ship1isOverLengthLimit || ship1isOverDraughtLimit);
		s2LargeVesselB1: !ship2InsideIstanbulStrait || ship2isFastEnough || !undercurrentsAboveLimit || !(ship2isOverLengthLimit || ship2isOverDraughtLimit);
	}
}
Explanation:
OS.undercurrent > kn(4) is mapped to undercurrentsAboveLimit = theMap.undercurrent > 4;
OS.Length > meters(150) is mapped to ship1isOverLengthLimit = s1.ship_length > 150;
OS.Draught > meters(10) is mapped to ship1isOverDraughtLimit = s1.ship_draught > 10;
OS.Velocity > kn(10) is mapped to ship1isFastEnough = s1.ship_velocity > 10;
The check if the vessel has entered the strait is mapped to ship1InsideIstanbulStrait = theMap.ship1_inside_istanbul_strait;


Instruction: In Rebeca syntax, create a property file that represents the law in the Legata clause. We are only interested in Assertions, not TCTL. After generating the property code, explain the intended semantic meaning of the Legata clause, and how the Legata clause attributes/conditions is mapped to the property variables/attributes. 
Allowed operators: <, >, ==, <=, >=, !, ||, &&, ^.
Do not use implication (->, =>) and do not define chained variables in define.

Legata clause to transform: 

define: {
    OS: OwnShip
}

    :OS.Operation has 'Vessel.Operation.UNDERWAY'
