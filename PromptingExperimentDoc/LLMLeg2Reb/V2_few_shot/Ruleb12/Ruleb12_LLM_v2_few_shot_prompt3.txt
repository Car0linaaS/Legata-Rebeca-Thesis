============= COMPLETE LLM OUTPUT =============
Here is the **Rebeca property file** that represents the Legata clause `Istanbul.Strait.Rule3.DangerousCargo`:

```rebeca
property {
	define {
		ship1CarriesHazardous = (s1.contains_hazardous);
		ship2CarriesHazardous = (s2.contains_hazardous);
		strongUndercurrent = (theMap.undercurrent > 1852); // 4 kn = 1852 meters per hour

		ship1IsFastEnough = (s1.ship_velocity > 4630); // 10 kn = 4630 meters per hour
		ship2IsFastEnough = (s2.ship_velocity > 4630);
	}

	Assertion {
		ship1rule3: (!(ship1CarriesHazardous && strongUndercurrent) || ship1IsFastEnough);
		ship2rule3: (!(ship2CarriesHazardous && strongUndercurrent) || ship2IsFastEnough);
	}
}
```

### 📘 Semantic Meaning of the Legata Clause

**Clause Intent**:
This clause enforces a safety regulation for navigating the Istanbul Strait. Specifically:

* If a vessel is carrying **hazardous cargo**, **and** the sea **undercurrent exceeds 4 knots**,
* Then the vessel **must be traveling faster than 10 knots** to enter the strait.

This is likely a precautionary regulation to ensure better control and maneuverability under challenging conditions, reducing the risk of accidents involving hazardous materials.

### 🔁 Mapping Legata Clause to Rebeca Property

| **Legata Attribute**                                            | **Mapped Rebeca Variable**                           | **Explanation**                                                              |                 |                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `OS.Cargo in ['HazardousMaterial']`                             | `s1.contains_hazardous`, `s2.contains_hazardous`     | Boolean flag in each ship indicating hazardous cargo                         |                 |                                                 |
| `OS.Undercurrent > kn(4)`                                       | `theMap.undercurrent > 1852`                         | Converts 4 knots to 1852 meters/hour (since speed is modeled in meters/hour) |                 |                                                 |
| `OS.Velocity > kn(10)`                                          | `s1.ship_velocity > 4630`, `s2.ship_velocity > 4630` | Converts 10 knots to 4630 meters/hour                                        |                 |                                                 |
| Logical form: `if (hazardous && undercurrent) => speed > 10 kn` | Translated to: \`!(hazardous && undercurrent)        |                                                                              | speed > 10 kn\` | Uses allowed logical operators (no implication) |

============= CRITERIA EVALUATION =============
Total points: 6/9

1. Is the syntax correct, so that we can run the proposed Rebeca property, without changes? (Yes=1p, No=0p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 1p

2. Are all relevant attributes included? (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p) (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p)
Answer: Partially
Points: 2p

Ship:
ship_hazardous ✅
ship_velocity ✅

theMap:
ship_inside_istanbul_strait ❌
undercurrent ✅

3. Are correctness properties created for all relevant actors? (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor) (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor)
Answer: Yes
Points: 2p

4. Is the output code free from hallucinations (e.g. any irrelevant code added)? (1p)
Answer: No
Points: 0p

Note: Probably because of our example, where we convert 0.5 knots to 926 meters, it
tries to convert 4 knots to metres per hour, and ends up 1852 meters per hour, which is actually
1 knot in metres per hour.
For 10 knots it then takes the previous value times 2.5 (4*2.5=10) and gets 4630 (1852*2.5=4630)
which would be 2.5 knots.

5. Is the logic correct? (2p (Full expression: 1p, Correct: 1p))
Answer: Not full expression, Correct
Points: 1p
