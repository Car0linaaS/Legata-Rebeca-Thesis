============= COMPLETE LLM OUTPUT =============
Here is the **Rebeca property file** that models the given Legata clause `Istanbul.Strait.Rule3.DangerousCargo`:

```rebeca
property {
	define {
		ship1Hazardous = (s1.contains_hazardous);
		ship2Hazardous = (s2.contains_hazardous);

		ship1Slow = (s1.ship_velocity <= 1852*10);
		ship2Slow = (s2.ship_velocity <= 1852*10);

		undercurrentStrong = (theMap.undercurrent > 1852*4);
	}

	Assertion {
		ship1RuleDangerousCargo: !(ship1Hazardous && undercurrentStrong && ship1Slow);
		ship2RuleDangerousCargo: !(ship2Hazardous && undercurrentStrong && ship2Slow);
	}
}
```

### 📘 **Semantic Meaning of the Legata Clause**

**Clause:** `Istanbul.Strait.Rule3.DangerousCargo`

**Intent:**
This regulation restricts vessels that:

* Carry **hazardous materials**
* Are moving **at 10 knots or less**
* While **undercurrent exceeds 4 knots**

Such vessels **must not enter the Istanbul Strait** under these conditions. The Legata clause formalizes this using a conditional requirement: if all these conditions hold, then the vessel's velocity must be greater than 10 knots.

### 🔁 **Mapping from Legata to Rebeca**

| Legata Element                      | Rebeca Mapping                                              | Explanation                                          |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `OS.Cargo in ['HazardousMaterial']` | `s1.contains_hazardous` / `s2.contains_hazardous`           | Boolean flag indicating presence of hazardous cargo  |
| `OS.Undercurrent > kn(4)`           | `theMap.undercurrent > 1852*4`                              | Converts knots to meters per hour (knots × 1852 m/h) |
| `OS.Velocity > kn(10)`              | `s1.ship_velocity > 1852*10` / `s2.ship_velocity > 1852*10` | Checks if ship speed exceeds 10 knots                |

### ✅ **Assertion Logic**

The assertion enforces that the **violation is not true**:

* It asserts that **either** the ship is not carrying hazardous cargo,
* **or** the undercurrent is not strong,
* **or** the ship is not slow.

In short: If a ship carries hazardous material and the undercurrent is strong, **it must not be slow** (≤10 knots). If all three are true, that is a violation, and the assertion fails.

Would you like this logic visualized in a flow diagram?

============= CRITERIA EVALUATION =============
Total points: 8/9

1. Is the syntax correct, so that we can run the proposed Rebeca property, without changes? (Yes=1p, No=0p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 1p

2. Are all relevant attributes included? (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p) (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p)
Answer: Partially
Points: 2p

Ship:
ship_hazardous ✅
ship_velocity ✅

theMap:
ship_inside_istanbul_strait ❌
undercurrent ✅

3. Are correctness properties created for all relevant actors? (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor) (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor)
Answer: Yes
Points: 2p

4. Is the output code free from hallucinations (e.g. any irrelevant code added)? (1p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 1p

Note: Probably because of our example, where we convert 0.5 knots to 926 meters, it
converts knots to meters per hour, but does it correctly

5. Is the logic correct? (2p (Full expression: 1p, Correct: 1p) )
Answer: Correct, not full expression
Points: 2p
