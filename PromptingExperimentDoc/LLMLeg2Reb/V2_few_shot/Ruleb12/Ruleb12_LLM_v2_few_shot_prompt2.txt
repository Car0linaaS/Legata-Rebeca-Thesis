============= COMPLETE LLM OUTPUT =============
Here is the **Rebeca property file** that models the given Legata clause `Istanbul.Strait.Rule3.DangerousCargo`:

```rebeca
property {
	define {
		ship1Hazardous = (s1.contains_hazardous);
		ship2Hazardous = (s2.contains_hazardous);

		ship1Slow = (s1.ship_velocity <= 1852*10);
		ship2Slow = (s2.ship_velocity <= 1852*10);

		undercurrentStrong = (theMap.undercurrent > 1852*4);
	}

	Assertion {
		ship1RuleDangerousCargo: !(ship1Hazardous && undercurrentStrong && ship1Slow);
		ship2RuleDangerousCargo: !(ship2Hazardous && undercurrentStrong && ship2Slow);
	}
}
```

### 📘 **Semantic Meaning of the Legata Clause**

**Clause:** `Istanbul.Strait.Rule3.DangerousCargo`

**Intent:**
This regulation restricts vessels that:

* Carry **hazardous materials**
* Are moving **at 10 knots or less**
* While **undercurrent exceeds 4 knots**

Such vessels **must not enter the Istanbul Strait** under these conditions. The Legata clause formalizes this using a conditional requirement: if all these conditions hold, then the vessel's velocity must be greater than 10 knots.

### 🔁 **Mapping from Legata to Rebeca**

| Legata Element                      | Rebeca Mapping                                              | Explanation                                          |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `OS.Cargo in ['HazardousMaterial']` | `s1.contains_hazardous` / `s2.contains_hazardous`           | Boolean flag indicating presence of hazardous cargo  |
| `OS.Undercurrent > kn(4)`           | `theMap.undercurrent > 1852*4`                              | Converts knots to meters per hour (knots × 1852 m/h) |
| `OS.Velocity > kn(10)`              | `s1.ship_velocity > 1852*10` / `s2.ship_velocity > 1852*10` | Checks if ship speed exceeds 10 knots                |

### ✅ **Assertion Logic**

The assertion enforces that the **violation is not true**:

* It asserts that **either** the ship is not carrying hazardous cargo,
* **or** the undercurrent is not strong,
* **or** the ship is not slow.

In short: If a ship carries hazardous material and the undercurrent is strong, **it must not be slow** (≤10 knots). If all three are true, that is a violation, and the assertion fails.

Would you like this logic visualized in a flow diagram?
