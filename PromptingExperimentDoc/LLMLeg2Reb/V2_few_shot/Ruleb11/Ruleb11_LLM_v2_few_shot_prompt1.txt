Here is the **Rebeca property file** that corresponds to the Legata clause `Istanbul.Strait.Rule3.LargeVessel`:

### ✅ Rebeca Property File

```rebeca
property {
	define {
		ship1isLarge = (s1.ship_length > 150);
		ship2isLarge = (s2.ship_length > 150);

		ship1isDeep = (s1.ship_draught > 10);
		ship2isDeep = (s2.ship_draught > 10);

		strongUndercurrent = (theMap.undercurrent > 7); // 4 kn ≈ 7.408 m/s, use threshold of 7 for practical integer comparison

		ship1TooSlow = (s1.ship_velocity <= 10);
		ship2TooSlow = (s2.ship_velocity <= 10);
	}

	Assertion {
		ship1Rule3: (!(ship1isLarge && strongUndercurrent && ship1TooSlow)
		             && !(ship1isDeep && strongUndercurrent && ship1TooSlow));

		ship2Rule3: (!(ship2isLarge && strongUndercurrent && ship2TooSlow)
		             && !(ship2isDeep && strongUndercurrent && ship2TooSlow));
	}
}
```

### 🔍 **Semantic Meaning of the Legata Clause**

The Legata clause titled `Istanbul.Strait.Rule3.LargeVessel` expresses a conditional restriction:

* If a ship is a **large vessel** (length > 150 meters) **or** a **deep-draught vessel** (draught > 10 meters),
* **And** the sea **undercurrent exceeds 4 knots**,
* Then that ship **must not enter the Istanbul Strait unless its speed is over 10 knots**.

The clause is effectively a **regulatory safeguard** against slow, large or deep vessels entering the strait during strong undercurrent, which can pose navigational hazards.

### 🔄 **Mapping from Legata Clause to Rebeca Property**

| **Legata Concept**                     | **Mapped Rebeca Expression**                                         |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OS.Length > meters(150)`              | `s1.ship_length > 150` (meters used directly)                        |
| `OS.Draught > meters(10)`              | `s1.ship_draught > 10`                                               |
| `OS.Undercurrent > kn(4)`              | `theMap.undercurrent > 7` (approx. 4 knots in m/s)                   |
| `OS.Velocity > kn(10)`                 | `s1.ship_velocity > 10`                                              |
| Clause assurance: ship must go > 10 kn | `ship_velocity > 10`, inverted as `shipTooSlow <=10`                 |
| Multiple conditions (OR logic)         | Modeled as separate AND-gated expressions joined via OR inside `!()` |

============= CRITERIA EVALUATION =============
Total points: 7/9

1. Is the syntax correct, so that we can run the proposed Rebeca property, without changes? (Yes=1p, No=0p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 1p

2. Are all relevant attributes included? (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p) (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p)
Answer: Partially
Points: 2p

Ship:
ship_length ✅
ship_draught ✅
ship_velocity ✅

theMap:
ship_inside_istanbul_strait ❌
undercurrent ✅

3. Are correctness properties created for all relevant actors? (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor) (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor)
Answer: Yes
Points: 2p

4. Is the output code free from hallucinations (e.g. any irrelevant code added)? (1p)
Answer: No
Points: 0p

Note: Probably because of our example, where we convert 0.5 knots to 926 meters, it
tries to convert 4 knots to m/s, and ends up with 7.408 (rounded down to 7), which is actually
4 knots in metres per hour divided by 1000.

5. Is the logic correct? (2p (Full expression: 1p, Correct: 1p) )
Answer: Correct, not full expression
Points: 2p

============= COMMENT =============
Our:
!A || B || !C || !(D || E)

Those varables based on our property file:
ship1InsideIstanbulStrait = A
ship1isFastEnough = B
undercurrentsAboveLimit = C
ship1isOverLengthLimit = D
ship1isOverDraughtLimit = E

Response:
(!(D && C && !B) && !(E && C && !B))
