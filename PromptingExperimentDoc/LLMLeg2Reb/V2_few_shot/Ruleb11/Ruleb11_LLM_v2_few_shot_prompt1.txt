### ✅ Rebeca Property File

```rebeca
property {
	define {
		ship1isLarge = (s1.ship_length > 150);
		ship2isLarge = (s2.ship_length > 150);

		ship1isDeep = (s1.ship_draught > 10);
		ship2isDeep = (s2.ship_draught > 10);

		strongUndercurrent = (theMap.undercurrent > 7); // 4 kn ≈ 7.408 m/s, use threshold of 7 for practical integer comparison

		ship1TooSlow = (s1.ship_velocity <= 10);
		ship2TooSlow = (s2.ship_velocity <= 10);
	}

	Assertion {
		ship1Rule3: (!(ship1isLarge && strongUndercurrent && ship1TooSlow)
		             && !(ship1isDeep && strongUndercurrent && ship1TooSlow));

		ship2Rule3: (!(ship2isLarge && strongUndercurrent && ship2TooSlow)
		             && !(ship2isDeep && strongUndercurrent && ship2TooSlow));
	}
}
```

### 🔍 **Semantic Meaning of the Legata Clause**

The Legata clause titled `Istanbul.Strait.Rule3.LargeVessel` expresses a conditional restriction:

* If a ship is a **large vessel** (length > 150 meters) **or** a **deep-draught vessel** (draught > 10 meters),
* **And** the sea **undercurrent exceeds 4 knots**,
* Then that ship **must not enter the Istanbul Strait unless its speed is over 10 knots**.

The clause is effectively a **regulatory safeguard** against slow, large or deep vessels entering the strait during strong undercurrent, which can pose navigational hazards.

### 🔄 **Mapping from Legata Clause to Rebeca Property**

| **Legata Concept**                     | **Mapped Rebeca Expression**                                         |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OS.Length > meters(150)`              | `s1.ship_length > 150` (meters used directly)                        |
| `OS.Draught > meters(10)`              | `s1.ship_draught > 10`                                               |
| `OS.Undercurrent > kn(4)`              | `theMap.undercurrent > 7` (approx. 4 knots in m/s)                   |
| `OS.Velocity > kn(10)`                 | `s1.ship_velocity > 10`                                              |
| Clause assurance: ship must go > 10 kn | `ship_velocity > 10`, inverted as `shipTooSlow <=10`                 |
| Multiple conditions (OR logic)         | Modeled as separate AND-gated expressions joined via OR inside `!()` |
