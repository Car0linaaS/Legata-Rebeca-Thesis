============= COMPLETE LLM OUTPUT =============
Here is the **Rebeca property file** corresponding to the given Legata clause:

```rebeca
property {
	define {
		ship1IsLarge = (s1.ship_length > 150);
		ship2IsLarge = (s2.ship_length > 150);
		
		ship1IsDeep = (s1.ship_draught > 10);
		ship2IsDeep = (s2.ship_draught > 10);
		
		currentStrong = (theMap.undercurrent > 740); // 4 knots in meters/minute
		
		ship1Slow = (s1.ship_velocity <= 1852); // 10 knots in meters/minute
		ship2Slow = (s2.ship_velocity <= 1852);
	}

	Assertion {
		ship1rule3: !( (currentStrong && (ship1IsLarge || ship1IsDeep)) && ship1Slow );
		ship2rule3: !( (currentStrong && (ship2IsLarge || ship2IsDeep)) && ship2Slow );
	}
}
```

### ✅ **Explanation of Semantic Meaning (Legata clause):**

The clause states that:

> **When the sea current exceeds 4 knots**, then:
>
> * **Large vessels** (length > 150 meters),
> * **Deep-draught vessels** (draught > 10 meters), or
> * **Hazardous cargo vessels** (not modeled here)
>
> **must not enter the strait if their speed is 10 knots or less**.

Since we are modeling only ship size and draught (not hazardous cargo), we focus on:

* If a ship is large or deep, and the undercurrent is strong (over 4 knots), **it must maintain a speed greater than 10 knots.**

### ✅ **Mapping of Legata Conditions to Rebeca Properties:**

| Legata Concept              | Rebeca Equivalent                                                    | Notes                                                 |          |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `OS.Length > meters(150)`   | `s1.ship_length > 150`                                               | Units assumed in meters.                              |          |
| `OS.Draught > meters(10)`   | `s1.ship_draught > 10`                                               | Units assumed in meters.                              |          |
| `OS.Undercurrent > kn(4)`   | `theMap.undercurrent > 740`                                          | 1 knot ≈ 0.5144 m/s = 30.86 m/min → 4 kn ≈ 740 m/min. |          |
| `OS.Velocity > kn(10)`      | `s1.ship_velocity > 1852`                                            | 10 knots ≈ 1852 m/min.                                |          |
| Assure clause               | Rebeca assertion enforces required condition if precondition is met. |                                                       |          |
| Multiple conditions (`and`) | Translated using Rebeca boolean operators (`&&`, \`                  |                                                       | `, `!\`) |

Would you like a version that also considers the third case, e.g., hazardous cargo, if such information becomes available in the model?

============= CRITERIA EVALUATION =============
Total points: 6/9

1. Is the syntax correct, so that we can run the proposed Rebeca property, without changes? (Yes=1p, No=0p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 1p

2. Are all relevant attributes included? (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p) (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p)
Answer: Partially
Points: 2p

Ship:
ship_length ✅
ship_draught ✅
ship_velocity ✅

theMap:
ship_inside_istanbul_strait ❌
undercurrent ✅

3. Are correctness properties created for all relevant actors? (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor) (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor)
Answer: Yes
Points: 2p

4. Is the output code free from hallucinations (e.g. any irrelevant code added)? (1p)
Answer: No
Points: 0p

Note: Probably because of our example, where we convert 0.5 knots to 926 meters, it
tries to convert 4 knots to metres per minute (which is ridiculous), and ends up with 740, which is actually
4 knots in metres per hour divided by 10.

5. Is the logic correct? (2p (Full expression: 1p, Correct: 1p) )
Answer: Correct, not full expression
Points: 1p

============= COMMENT =============
Our:
!A || B || !C || !(D || E)

Those varables based on our property file:
ship1InsideIstanbulStrait = A
ship1isFastEnough = B
undercurrentsAboveLimit = C

ship1isOverDraughtLimit = E

Response:
!( (C && (D || E)) && !B )
