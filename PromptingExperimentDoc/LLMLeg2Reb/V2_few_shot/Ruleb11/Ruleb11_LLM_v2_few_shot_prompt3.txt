============= COMPLETE LLM OUTPUT =============
Here is the **Rebeca property file** that represents the Legata clause `Istanbul.Strait.Rule3.LargeVessel`:

```rebeca
property{
	define {
		ship1isLarge = (s1.ship_length > 150);
		ship2isLarge = (s2.ship_length > 150);

		ship1isDeepDraught = (s1.ship_draught > 10);
		ship2isDeepDraught = (s2.ship_draught > 10);

		undercurrentStrong = (theMap.undercurrent > 7408); // 4 knots in meters/hour

		ship1Slow = (s1.ship_velocity <= 18520); // 10 knots in meters/hour
		ship2Slow = (s2.ship_velocity <= 18520); // 10 knots in meters/hour
	}

	Assertion {
		ship1rule3: !(undercurrentStrong && ((ship1isLarge || ship1isDeepDraught) && ship1Slow));
		ship2rule3: !(undercurrentStrong && ((ship2isLarge || ship2isDeepDraught) && ship2Slow));
	}
}
```

### **Explanation of the Legata Clause Semantics**

**Legata Clause Summary**:
If the **sea undercurrent exceeds 4 knots**, then ships that are either:

* **Large vessels** (length > 150 meters), or
* **Deep-draught vessels** (draught > 10 meters)
  **must not enter the strait if they are moving slower than 10 knots**.

**Rebeca Property Mapping**:

* `OS.Length > meters(150)` → `ship1isLarge = (s1.ship_length > 150)`

* `OS.Draught > meters(10)` → `ship1isDeepDraught = (s1.ship_draught > 10)`

* `OS.Undercurrent > kn(4)` → `undercurrentStrong = (theMap.undercurrent > 7408)`

  * (4 knots ≈ 7408 meters/hour)

* `OS.Velocity > kn(10)` becomes a negated check for invalidity:
  Ships **must** have speed **>10 kn**, so slow ships under strong current are disallowed:
  `ship1Slow = (s1.ship_velocity <= 18520)`

  * (10 knots ≈ 18520 meters/hour)

* The final assertion checks that **if the undercurrent is strong and the ship is large or deep-draught, it must not be slow**. That is:

  ```rebeca
  !(undercurrentStrong && ((ship1isLarge || ship1isDeepDraught) && ship1Slow))
  ```

This means any such ship must exceed 10 knots if trying to enter the strait under strong current.
