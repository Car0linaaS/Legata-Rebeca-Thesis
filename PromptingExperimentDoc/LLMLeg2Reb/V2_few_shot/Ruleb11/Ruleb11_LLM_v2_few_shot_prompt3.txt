============= COMPLETE LLM OUTPUT =============
Here is the **Rebeca property file** that represents the Legata clause `Istanbul.Strait.Rule3.LargeVessel`:

```rebeca
property{
	define {
		ship1isLarge = (s1.ship_length > 150);
		ship2isLarge = (s2.ship_length > 150);

		ship1isDeepDraught = (s1.ship_draught > 10);
		ship2isDeepDraught = (s2.ship_draught > 10);

		undercurrentStrong = (theMap.undercurrent > 7408); // 4 knots in meters/hour

		ship1Slow = (s1.ship_velocity <= 18520); // 10 knots in meters/hour
		ship2Slow = (s2.ship_velocity <= 18520); // 10 knots in meters/hour
	}

	Assertion {
		ship1rule3: !(undercurrentStrong && ((ship1isLarge || ship1isDeepDraught) && ship1Slow));
		ship2rule3: !(undercurrentStrong && ((ship2isLarge || ship2isDeepDraught) && ship2Slow));
	}
}
```

### **Explanation of the Legata Clause Semantics**

**Legata Clause Summary**:
If the **sea undercurrent exceeds 4 knots**, then ships that are either:

* **Large vessels** (length > 150 meters), or
* **Deep-draught vessels** (draught > 10 meters)
  **must not enter the strait if they are moving slower than 10 knots**.

**Rebeca Property Mapping**:

* `OS.Length > meters(150)` → `ship1isLarge = (s1.ship_length > 150)`

* `OS.Draught > meters(10)` → `ship1isDeepDraught = (s1.ship_draught > 10)`

* `OS.Undercurrent > kn(4)` → `undercurrentStrong = (theMap.undercurrent > 7408)`

  * (4 knots ≈ 7408 meters/hour)

* `OS.Velocity > kn(10)` becomes a negated check for invalidity:
  Ships **must** have speed **>10 kn**, so slow ships under strong current are disallowed:
  `ship1Slow = (s1.ship_velocity <= 18520)`

  * (10 knots ≈ 18520 meters/hour)

* The final assertion checks that **if the undercurrent is strong and the ship is large or deep-draught, it must not be slow**. That is:

  ```rebeca
  !(undercurrentStrong && ((ship1isLarge || ship1isDeepDraught) && ship1Slow))
  ```

This means any such ship must exceed 10 knots if trying to enter the strait under strong current.

============= CRITERIA EVALUATION =============
Total points: 7/9

1. Is the syntax correct, so that we can run the proposed Rebeca property, without changes? (Yes=1p, No=0p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 1p

2. Are all relevant attributes included? (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p) (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p)
Answer: Partially
Points: 2p

Ship:
ship_length ✅
ship_draught ✅
ship_velocity ✅

theMap:
ship_inside_istanbul_strait ❌
undercurrent ✅

3. Are correctness properties created for all relevant actors? (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor) (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor)
Answer: Yes
Points: 2p

4. Is the output code free from hallucinations (e.g. any irrelevant code added)? (1p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 1p

Note: Probably because of our example, where we convert 0.5 knots to 926 meters, it
converts knots to meters per hour, but does it correctly

5. Is the logic correct? (2p (Full expression: 1p, Correct: 1p) )
Answer: Correct, not full expression
Points: 1p
