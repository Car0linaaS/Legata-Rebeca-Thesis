Here is the **Rebeca property file** that represents the Legata clause `IstanbulStrait.Clause.1`:

### âœ… **Rebeca Property File**

```rebeca
property{
	define {
		ship1NearTrafficZone = theMap.ship1_inside_traffic_zone;
		ship1HasEnoughVisibility = s1.vis_range > 0.5;

		ship2NearTrafficZone = theMap.ship2_inside_traffic_zone;
		ship2HasEnoughVisibility = s2.vis_range > 0.5;
	}

	Assertion {
		s1VisibilityCompliance: !ship1NearTrafficZone || ship1HasEnoughVisibility;
		s2VisibilityCompliance: !ship2NearTrafficZone || ship2HasEnoughVisibility;
	}
}
```

### ðŸ“˜ **Explanation**

#### ðŸ”¹ **Legata Clause Semantics:**

This clause specifies that **if a ship is in *near proximity* to the Istanbul Strait traffic zone**, then it must have **a visibility range greater than 0.5 nautical miles (kn)**. The goal is to **prevent entry or operation in a restricted area under poor visibility**, ensuring navigational safety.

#### ðŸ”¹ **Mapping from Legata to Rebeca:**

| Legata Element                                                        | Rebeca Mapping                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OwnShip in Map.Sea@TrafficZone.Distance in Area.Near.ProximityRange` | `ship1NearTrafficZone = theMap.ship1_inside_traffic_zone;` |
| `OS.Visibility.Range > kn(.5)`                                        | `ship1HasEnoughVisibility = s1.vis_range > 0.5;`           |

This mapping is done for both **s1** and **s2**, as they are the vessels of interest.

#### ðŸ”¹ **Assertion Semantics:**

Each assertion ensures that:

* Either the ship is **not** near the traffic zone, or
* The ship **has sufficient visibility** (> 0.5 kn)

This guards against scenarios where a vessel with poor visibility might enter or operate close to the traffic zone, which is non-compliant with the rule.

Would you like me to help translate more Legata clauses into Rebeca assertions?
