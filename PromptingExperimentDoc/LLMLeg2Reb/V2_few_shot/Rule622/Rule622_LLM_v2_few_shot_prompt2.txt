============= COMPLETE LLM OUTPUT =============
Here is the **Rebeca property file** that represents the Legata clause `'IstanbulStrait.Clause.1'`:

```rebeca
property{
	define {
		ship1NearTrafficZone = theMap.ship1_inside_traffic_zone;
		ship1VisibilityAdequate = s1.vis_range > 0.5;

		ship2NearTrafficZone = theMap.ship2_inside_traffic_zone;
		ship2VisibilityAdequate = s2.vis_range > 0.5;
	}

	Assertion {
		s1VisibilityCheck: !ship1NearTrafficZone || ship1VisibilityAdequate;
		s2VisibilityCheck: !ship2NearTrafficZone || ship2VisibilityAdequate;
	}
}
```

### **Semantic Meaning of the Legata Clause**

The clause `'IstanbulStrait.Clause.1'` expresses a **visibility requirement for vessels near a traffic zone in the Istanbul Strait**. The rule states:

* **Condition**: If a ship (OwnShip) is **near** the traffic zone (`Distance in Area.Near.ProximityRange`)
* **Assurance**: Then the ship's **visibility range** must be **greater than 0.5 nautical miles**

This is a **safety regulation**, likely intended to prevent ships from entering busy or narrow traffic zones with poor visibility, which could lead to collisions or navigation hazards.

### **Mapping Legata Attributes to Rebeca Property Variables**

| **Legata Expression**                          | **Mapped Rebeca Variable**         | **Explanation**                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OwnShip.Distance in Area.Near.ProximityRange` | `theMap.ship1_inside_traffic_zone` | Assumes proximity is captured by boolean zone presence  |
| `OwnShip.Visibility.Range > kn(.5)`            | `s1.vis_range > 0.5`               | Visibility range stored directly in `s1` as `vis_range` |
| `OwnShip` â†’ both `s1` and `s2`                 | `ship1`, `ship2`                   | Applied to both ships independently                     |

Would you like a version that uses a more precise spatial model instead of the boolean traffic zone flag?
