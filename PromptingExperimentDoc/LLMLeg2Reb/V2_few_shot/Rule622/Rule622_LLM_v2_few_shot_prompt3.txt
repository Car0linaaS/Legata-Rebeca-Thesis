============= COMPLETE LLM OUTPUT =============
Here is the **Rebeca property file** that represents the Legata clause `IstanbulStrait.Clause.1`:

```rebeca
property{
	define {
		ship1NearTrafficZone = theMap.ship1_inside_traffic_zone;
		ship1VisibilitySufficient = s1.vis_range > 0.5;

		ship2NearTrafficZone = theMap.ship2_inside_traffic_zone;
		ship2VisibilitySufficient = s2.vis_range > 0.5;
	}

	Assertion {
		s1ProximityVisibilityRule: !ship1NearTrafficZone || ship1VisibilitySufficient;
		s2ProximityVisibilityRule: !ship2NearTrafficZone || ship2VisibilitySufficient;
	}
}
```

### âœ… **Explanation of Semantic Meaning (Legata â†’ Rebeca Translation)**

#### ðŸ”¸ **Legata Clause Summary**

This clause states:

> *If a vessel (OwnShip) is in near proximity to the Istanbul Strait Traffic Zone, it must have a visibility range greater than 0.5 nautical miles to comply with the regulation.*

---

#### ðŸ”¸ **Condition Mapping**

* **Legata:**
  `OwnShip, Map.Sea@TrafficZone].Distance in Area.Near.ProximityRange`
  means the vessel is **close to the traffic zone**.

* **Rebeca Mapping:**
  This is mapped to the boolean variable:
  `ship1NearTrafficZone = theMap.ship1_inside_traffic_zone;`
  and similarly for `ship2`.

  While the Legata clause specifies a spatial condition, the Rebeca model abstracts this into a boolean flag `shipX_inside_traffic_zone`, indicating whether the ship is within the near proximity of the traffic zone.

---

#### ðŸ”¸ **Assure Mapping**

* **Legata:**
  `OS.Visibility.Range > kn(0.5)`
  means the shipâ€™s **visibility range must exceed 0.5 nautical miles**.

* **Rebeca Mapping:**
  This is mapped as:
  `ship1VisibilitySufficient = s1.vis_range > 0.5;`
  and similarly for `ship2`.

---

#### ðŸ”¸ **Assertion Logic**

* The assertion:
  `!ship1NearTrafficZone || ship1VisibilitySufficient;`
  ensures that either the ship is not in the near traffic zone, **or** it has sufficient visibility.
  This directly reflects the semantic intention: *you must not be near the zone with low visibility.*
