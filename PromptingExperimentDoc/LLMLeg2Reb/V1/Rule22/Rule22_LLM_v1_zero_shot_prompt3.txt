Here is the **Rebeca property file** that captures the Legata clause `COLREG.Rule22.a` in Rebeca syntax:

### âœ… **Rebeca Property File**

```rebeca
property {
    define {
        OwnShip_Long = (s1.ship_length > 50);
        MastheadLight_OK = (s1.masthead_light_range >= 6);
        SideLight_OK = (s1.side_light_range >= 3);
        SternLight_OK = (s1.stern_light_range >= 3);
        TowingLight_OK = (s1.towing_light_range >= 3);
        SignalLight_OK = (s1.signal_light_range >= 3);
    }

    Assertion {
        COLREG_Rule22a_Compliance:
        (!OwnShip_Long) || 
        (MastheadLight_OK && SideLight_OK && SternLight_OK && TowingLight_OK && SignalLight_OK);
    }
}
```

### ðŸ“˜ **Explanation and Mapping from Legata Clause to Rebeca Property**

#### ðŸ§  **Semantic Meaning of the Legata Clause `COLREG.Rule22.a`:**

This clause is part of **Rule 22 of the COLREG**, which defines **minimum visibility ranges for navigational lights** on vessels. Specifically, for **vessels that are 50 meters or more in length**, the regulation requires:

- A masthead light visible for at least **6 nautical miles**,
- Sidelight, sternlight, towing light, and all-round light (which includes signal lights) visible for at least **3 nautical miles** each.

The clause ensures that such ships are properly equipped with sufficiently powerful lighting for visibility and safety during night or restricted visibility conditions.

#### ðŸ”„ **Mapping Legata Attributes to Rebeca Properties:**

| **Legata**                          | **Rebeca Mapping**                              | **Description**                                        |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `OS.Length > meters(50)`           | `s1.ship_length > 50`                            | Checks if the own ship (`s1`) is 50 meters or longer   |
| `OS.Equipment.MastheadLight.Range` | `s1.masthead_light_range`                        | Masthead light range in nautical miles                |
| `OS.Equipment.SideLight.Range`     | `s1.side_light_range`                            | Sidelight range in nautical miles                     |
| `OS.Equipment.SternLight.Range`    | `s1.stern_light_range`                           | Sternlight range in nautical miles                    |
| `OS.Equipment.TowingLight.Range`   | `s1.towing_light_range`                          | Towing light range in nautical miles                  |
| `OS.Equipment.SignalLight.Range`   | `s1.signal_light_range`                          | Signal (all-round) light range in nautical miles      |

The assertion uses logical structure:
- If the ship is **not** over 50 meters, the rule does **not apply** â€” thus, it's trivially true.
- If the ship **is** over 50 meters, then **all five light ranges must meet the minimum** requirements for the assertion to hold.

This captures the **conditional applicability** and **mandatory requirements** of Rule 22(a) faithfully in the Rebeca model.

Let me know if you want to model this for ship `s2` as well, or combine both ships in a broader compliance check!

============= CRITERIA EVALUATION =============
Total points: 10/10

1. Is the syntax correct, so that we can run the proposed Rebeca property, without changes? (Yes=1p, No=0p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 1p

2. Are all relevant attributes included? (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p) (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 3p

Attributes:
Ship: [exists for ship]
ship_length âœ…
masthead_light_range âœ…
side_light_range âœ…
stern_light_range âœ…
towing_light_range âœ…
signal_light_range âœ…

Note: We also checked that the light exist, which shouldn't be needed if the light has a range
masthead_light
side_light
stern_light
towing_light
signal_light


3. Are correctness properties created for all relevant actors? (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor) (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor)
Answer: Yes
Points: 2p

4. Is the output code free from hallucinations (e.g. any irrelevant code added)? (1p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 1p

5. Is the logic correct? (3p (Correct: 2p, Partially correct: 1p) + (Full expression:1p))
Answer: Correct, Full expression 
Points: 3p

(!A) || (B && C && D && E && F)

============= COMMENT =============
Apart from not checking "if lights exist" (which it does by checking the visibility range of the light instead), it mirrors our property.
