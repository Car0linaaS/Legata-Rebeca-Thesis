Here's how the **Legata clause** is translated into a **Rebeca property file**:

---

### ✅ Rebeca Property File

```rebeca
property {
    define {
        ShipLengthOK = (s1.ship_length > 50);
        MastheadLightVisible = (s1.masthead_light_range >= 6);
        SideLightVisible = (s1.side_light_range >= 3);
        SternLightVisible = (s1.stern_light_range >= 3);
        TowingLightVisible = (s1.towing_light_range >= 3);
        SignalLightVisible = (s1.signal_light_range >= 3);
    }

    Assertion {
        COLREG_Rule22_a_Assertion: (ShipLengthOK && MastheadLightVisible && SideLightVisible && SternLightVisible && TowingLightVisible && SignalLightVisible);
    }
}
```

### 🧠 Semantic Explanation of the Legata Clause

**Clause Title:** `COLREG.Rule22.a`  
**Topic:** *Visibility requirements for navigational lights on vessels.*

---

### 🌊 Meaning of the Rule

This rule is derived from **COLREG Rule 22**, specifically section (a). It mandates that vessels **50 meters or more in length** must have navigational lights that are **visible at specified minimum ranges** for safety and regulatory compliance.

Specifically, the minimum visible ranges required are:
- **Masthead Light**: 6 nautical miles
- **Side Light**: 3 nautical miles
- **Stern Light**: 3 nautical miles
- **Towing Light**: 3 nautical miles
- **All-round Light (e.g., signal light)**: 3 nautical miles

### 🔁 Mapping Legata → Rebeca

| **Legata Concept**                           | **Rebeca State Variable**              | **Explanation**                                |
|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `OS.Length > meters(50)`                    | `s1.ship_length > 50`                  | Ship is 50 meters or longer                   |
| `OS.Equipment.MastheadLight.Range >= 6`     | `s1.masthead_light_range >= 6`         | Masthead light must be visible at 6 miles     |
| `OS.Equipment.SideLight.Range >= 3`         | `s1.side_light_range >= 3`             | Side light visibility                         |
| `OS.Equipment.SternLight.Range >= 3`        | `s1.stern_light_range >= 3`            | Stern light visibility                        |
| `OS.Equipment.TowingLight.Range >= 3`       | `s1.towing_light_range >= 3`           | Towing light visibility                       |
| `OS.Equipment.SignalLight.Range >= 3`       | `s1.signal_light_range >= 3`           | Signal light visibility (all-round light)     |

Let me know if you want the property for a different ship (e.g., `s2`), or if you'd like to include this as part of a broader COLREG simulation framework.
