### ðŸ“„ Rebeca Property File for COLREG.Rule22.a

```rebeca
property {
    define {
        OS_Length_GT_50 = (s1.ship_length > 50);
        OS_MastheadLight_OK = (s1.masthead_light_range >= 6);
        OS_SideLight_OK = (s1.side_light_range >= 3);
        OS_SternLight_OK = (s1.stern_light_range >= 3);
        OS_TowingLight_OK = (s1.towing_light_range >= 3);
        OS_SignalLight_OK = (s1.signal_light_range >= 3);
    }

    Assertion {
        COLREG_Rule22a_Compliance: 
        (OS_Length_GT_50 && 
         OS_MastheadLight_OK &&
         OS_SideLight_OK &&
         OS_SternLight_OK &&
         OS_TowingLight_OK &&
         OS_SignalLight_OK);
    }
}
```

### ðŸ§  Semantic Meaning of the Clause

This clause from **COLREG Rule 22(a)** specifies visibility requirements for navigation lights on **vessels that are 50 meters or more in length**. Each specified light (masthead, sidelights, sternlight, towing light, and all-round signal light) must be visible at a **minimum distance**, to ensure that the vessel can be seen by others in various conditions (like night or fog).

In essence:
- **Condition**: The vessel is 50 meters or longer.
- **Assurance**: All the prescribed lights must meet or exceed specific visibility ranges.

### ðŸ”„ Mapping from Legata Clause to Rebeca Property

| **Legata Attribute**                                | **Mapped Rebeca Variable**       | **Explanation**                                       |
|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `OS.Length > meters(50)`                            | `s1.ship_length > 50`            | Checking the vessel length                           |
| `OS.Equipment.MastheadLight.Range >= miles(6)`      | `s1.masthead_light_range >= 6`   | Minimum visibility of masthead light                 |
| `OS.Equipment.SideLight.Range >= miles(3)`          | `s1.side_light_range >= 3`       | Minimum visibility of sidelights                     |
| `OS.Equipment.SternLight.Range >= miles(3)`         | `s1.stern_light_range >= 3`      | Minimum visibility of sternlight                     |
| `OS.Equipment.TowingLight.Range >= miles(3)`        | `s1.towing_light_range >= 3`     | Minimum visibility of towing light                   |
| `OS.Equipment.SignalLight.Range >= miles(3)`        | `s1.signal_light_range >= 3`     | Minimum visibility of all-round signal light         |

Let me know if you'd like to apply this to `s2` as well, or generate a version for multiple vessels!

============= CRITERIA EVALUATION =============


Total points: 8/9

1. Is the syntax correct, so that we can run the proposed Rebeca property, without changes? (Yes=1p, No=0p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 1p

2. Are all relevant attributes included? (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p) (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 3p

Attributes:
Ship: [exists for ship]
ship_length âœ…
masthead_light_range âœ…
side_light_range âœ…
stern_light_range âœ…
towing_light_range âœ…
signal_light_range âœ…

Note: We also checked that the light exist, which shouldn't be needed if the light has a range
masthead_light
side_light
stern_light
towing_light
signal_light


3. Are correctness properties created for all relevant actors? (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor) (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor)
Answer: Yes
Points: 2p

4. Is the output code free from hallucinations (e.g. any irrelevant code added)? (1p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 1p

5. Is the logic correct? (2p (Full expression: 1p, Correct: 1p) )
Answer: Full expression, not correct 
Points: 1p

(A && B && C && D && E && F)

============= COMMENT =============
Checks all attributes, but makes the assertion fail when if the ship is shorter than 50m.

!A || (B && C && D && E && F)
