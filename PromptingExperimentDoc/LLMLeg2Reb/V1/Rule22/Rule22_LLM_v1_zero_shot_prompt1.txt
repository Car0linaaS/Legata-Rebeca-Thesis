### ðŸ“„ Rebeca Property File for COLREG.Rule22.a

```rebeca
property {
    define {
        OS_Length_GT_50 = (s1.ship_length > 50);
        OS_MastheadLight_OK = (s1.masthead_light_range >= 6);
        OS_SideLight_OK = (s1.side_light_range >= 3);
        OS_SternLight_OK = (s1.stern_light_range >= 3);
        OS_TowingLight_OK = (s1.towing_light_range >= 3);
        OS_SignalLight_OK = (s1.signal_light_range >= 3);
    }

    Assertion {
        COLREG_Rule22a_Compliance: 
        (OS_Length_GT_50 && 
         OS_MastheadLight_OK &&
         OS_SideLight_OK &&
         OS_SternLight_OK &&
         OS_TowingLight_OK &&
         OS_SignalLight_OK);
    }
}
```

### ðŸ§  Semantic Meaning of the Clause

This clause from **COLREG Rule 22(a)** specifies visibility requirements for navigation lights on **vessels that are 50 meters or more in length**. Each specified light (masthead, sidelights, sternlight, towing light, and all-round signal light) must be visible at a **minimum distance**, to ensure that the vessel can be seen by others in various conditions (like night or fog).

In essence:
- **Condition**: The vessel is 50 meters or longer.
- **Assurance**: All the prescribed lights must meet or exceed specific visibility ranges.

| **Legata Attribute**                                | **Mapped Rebeca Variable**       | **Explanation**                                       |
|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `OS.Length > meters(50)`                            | `s1.ship_length > 50`            | Checking the vessel length                           |
| `OS.Equipment.MastheadLight.Range >= miles(6)`      | `s1.masthead_light_range >= 6`   | Minimum visibility of masthead light                 |
| `OS.Equipment.SideLight.Range >= miles(3)`          | `s1.side_light_range >= 3`       | Minimum visibility of sidelights                     |
| `OS.Equipment.SternLight.Range >= miles(3)`         | `s1.stern_light_range >= 3`      | Minimum visibility of sternlight                     |
| `OS.Equipment.TowingLight.Range >= miles(3)`        | `s1.towing_light_range >= 3`     | Minimum visibility of towing light                   |
| `OS.Equipment.SignalLight.Range >= miles(3)`        | `s1.signal_light_range >= 3`     | Minimum visibility of all-round signal light         |

Let me know if you'd like to apply this to `s2` as well, or generate a version for multiple vessels!
