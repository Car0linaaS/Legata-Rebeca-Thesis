### ✅ **Rebeca Property File**
```rebeca
property {
    define {
        ship1_hazardous = (s1.contains_hazardous == true);
        undercurrent_strong = (theMap.undercurrent > 4);
        ship1_fast = (s1.ship_velocity > 10);
    }

    Assertion {
        DangerousCargoSpeedRequirement: !(ship1_hazardous && undercurrent_strong) || ship1_fast;
    }
}
```

### 🔍 **Explanation of Mapping and Semantics**

#### 📜 **Legata Clause Meaning**:
The Legata clause `Istanbul.Strait.Rule3.DangerousCargo` sets a **requirement** for a vessel carrying hazardous material:  
- If the **own ship (OS)** is carrying **HazardousMaterial**,  
- **and** the **undercurrent** is **greater than 4 knots**,  
- then the **ship's velocity** must be **greater than 10 knots**.

This is a regulatory clause aimed at ensuring vessels with dangerous cargo maintain higher speeds in strong currents to preserve maneuverability and safety.

#### 🔄 **Mapping Legata to Rebeca**:

| **Legata Attribute**              | **Rebeca Variable**                    | **Notes**                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `OS.Cargo in ['HazardousMaterial']` | `s1.contains_hazardous == true`         | Representing ship 1 carrying hazardous cargo                             |
| `OS.Undercurrent > kn(4)`        | `theMap.undercurrent > 4`              | "kn(4)" assumed to be 4 knots; directly mapped to an integer value       |
| `OS.Velocity > kn(10)`           | `s1.ship_velocity > 10`                | Velocity is compared against threshold                                   |

#### 🧠 **Why use `!(A && B) || C` instead of implication**?

Because Rebeca property syntax does **not allow implication**, we rewrite:
```
IF (A AND B) THEN C
```
as:
```
!(A AND B) || C
```
Which is logically equivalent.

So:
```rebeca
!(ship1_hazardous && undercurrent_strong) || ship1_fast;
```
ensures that *if* the ship is carrying hazardous material *and* the undercurrent is strong, then it must be moving faster than 10 knots.

Let me know if you’d like to adapt this for `s2` as well or simulate multiple vessels!
