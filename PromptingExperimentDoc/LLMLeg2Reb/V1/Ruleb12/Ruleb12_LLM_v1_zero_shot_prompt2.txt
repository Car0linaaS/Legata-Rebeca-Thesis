============= COMPLETE LLM OUTPUT =============
Here is the **Rebeca property file** that encodes the semantics of the `Istanbul.Strait.Rule3.DangerousCargo` clause from Legata:

---

### 🛡️ **Rebeca Property File**

```rebeca
property {
    define {
        ship1_hazardous = (s1.contains_hazardous == true);
        ship2_hazardous = (s2.contains_hazardous == true);
        strong_undercurrent = (theMap.undercurrent > 4);
        ship1_low_speed = (s1.ship_velocity <= 10);
        ship2_low_speed = (s2.ship_velocity <= 10);
    }

    Assertion {
        NoHazardousEntry_s1: !(ship1_hazardous && strong_undercurrent && ship1_low_speed);
        NoHazardousEntry_s2: !(ship2_hazardous && strong_undercurrent && ship2_low_speed);
    }
}
```

---

### 🧠 **Explanation & Semantics**

#### ✅ **Legata Clause Summary**

The Legata clause states:

> If a vessel **carries hazardous material** and the **sea current exceeds 4 knots**, then it must be traveling **faster than 10 knots** to enter the Istanbul Strait.

In simpler terms: under strong undercurrent conditions, **slow-moving hazardous cargo ships are not allowed** in the strait.

---

#### 🔄 **Mapping Legata → Rebeca**

| Legata Concept                         | Rebeca Equivalent                       |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `OS.Cargo in ['HazardousMaterial']`    | `s1.contains_hazardous == true` (or `s2`) |
| `OS.Undercurrent > kn(4)`              | `theMap.undercurrent > 4`               |
| `OS.Velocity > kn(10)`                 | `s1.ship_velocity > 10` (or `s2`)       |

---

#### ⚙️ **Logic of the Assertion**

In Rebeca, we enforce **what should not be allowed**:

> A ship **must not** be in the state where it is:  
> carrying hazardous cargo `&&` strong undercurrent `&&` moving at 10 knots or less.

That’s why we write the assertion using **negation (`!`)** of this illegal condition.

---

Let me know if you want this modeled for only one ship, or expanded with other vessel types (like "large" or "deep-draught" vessels).

============= CRITERIA EVALUATION =============
Total points: 7/9

1. Is the syntax correct, so that we can run the proposed Rebeca property, without changes? (Yes=1p, No=0p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 1p

2. Are all relevant attributes included? (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p) (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p)
Answer: Partially
Points: 2p

Ship:
ship_hazardous ✅
ship_velocity ✅

theMap:
ship_inside_istanbul_strait ❌
undercurrent ✅

3. Are correctness properties created for all relevant actors? (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor) (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor)
Answer: Yes
Points: 2p

4. Is the output code free from hallucinations (e.g. any irrelevant code added)? (1p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 1p

5. Is the logic correct? (2p (Full expression: 1p, Correct: 1p))
Answer: Not full expression, Correct
Points: 1p
