### ✅ Rebeca Property File (Assertion-based) for Legata Clause `Istanbul.Strait.Rule3.DangerousCargo`

```rebeca
property {
    define {
        ship1_has_dangerous_cargo = (s1.contains_hazardous == true);
        ship2_has_dangerous_cargo = (s2.contains_hazardous == true);
        strong_undercurrent = (theMap.undercurrent > 4);
        ship1_high_velocity = (s1.ship_velocity > 10);
        ship2_high_velocity = (s2.ship_velocity > 10);
    }

    Assertion {
        Ship1_Complies_With_DangerousCargoRule: 
            !(ship1_has_dangerous_cargo && strong_undercurrent) || ship1_high_velocity;
    }

    Assertion {
        Ship2_Complies_With_DangerousCargoRule: 
            !(ship2_has_dangerous_cargo && strong_undercurrent) || ship2_high_velocity;

### 💡 Semantic Explanation of the Legata Clause and Mapping

#### **Clause Summary (Legata)**
- **Rule Name**: `Istanbul.Strait.Rule3.DangerousCargo`
- **Applicability**: Applies to an "OwnShip" (OS)
- **Condition**: The ship has **hazardous cargo** *and* the **undercurrent is stronger than 4 knots**
- **Assure**: In such a situation, the ship’s **velocity must be greater than 10 knots**

#### **Intended Semantics**
The law mandates that any vessel carrying hazardous cargo must maintain a **minimum speed of over 10 knots** if it’s operating in an area where the **undercurrent exceeds 4 knots**. This likely reflects safety or navigational control measures in a hazardous or narrow waterway (like the Istanbul Strait).

### 🧭 Mapping Legata to Timed Rebeca

| **Legata Element**                       | **Rebeca Model Representation**                           |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `OS.Cargo in ['HazardousMaterial']`      | `s1.contains_hazardous == true` / `s2.contains_hazardous == true` |
| `OS.Undercurrent > kn(4)`                | `theMap.undercurrent > 4`                                 |
| `OS.Velocity > kn(10)`                   | `s1.ship_velocity > 10` / `s2.ship_velocity > 10`         |

Note: We assume `kn(x)` is already represented in Rebeca units (int), so no conversion is shown here.
