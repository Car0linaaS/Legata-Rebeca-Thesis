============= COMPLETE LLM OUTPUT =============
Here is the **Rebeca property file** that represents the Legata clause `Istanbul.Strait.Rule3.DangerousCargo`:

### ✅ **Rebeca Property File**

```rebeca
property {
    define {
        ship1_carries_hazardous = (s1.contains_hazardous == true);
        ship1_velocity_low = (s1.ship_velocity <= 10);
        strong_undercurrent = (theMap.undercurrent > 4);
        ship1_in_strait = (theMap.ship1_inside_istanbul_strait == true);
    }

    Assertion {
        NoHazardousShipEntersStrait: !((ship1_carries_hazardous && ship1_velocity_low && strong_undercurrent) && ship1_in_strait);
    }
}
```

### ✅ **Semantic Explanation and Mapping**

#### 📝 **Legata Clause Summary**
The clause enforces a maritime safety protocol for navigating the **Istanbul Strait**. Specifically, if:
- A ship carries **hazardous cargo**, and
- The **undercurrent exceeds 4 knots**, and
- The ship's **speed is 10 knots or less**,

Then **that ship is not allowed to enter the strait**.

### 🔁 **Mapping Legata to Rebeca Properties**

| **Legata Clause Attribute**                          | **Mapped Rebeca Variable / Expression**                         | **Description**                                                   |
|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `OS.Cargo in ['HazardousMaterial']`                 | `s1.contains_hazardous == true`                                 | Whether the ship carries hazardous cargo                         |
| `OS.Undercurrent > kn(4)`                           | `theMap.undercurrent > 4`                                       | Undercurrent condition as tracked by the `MapServer`             |
| `OS.Velocity > kn(10)`                              | `s1.ship_velocity > 10` → used via `ship1_velocity_low <= 10`   | Ship velocity check (we flip it to detect violation condition)   |
| **Entering the strait** (implicit in Legata)         | `theMap.ship1_inside_istanbul_strait == true`                   | Whether the ship is in the Istanbul Strait                       |

---

### ✅ **Assertion Logic**

The assertion ensures that a ship which:
- Carries hazardous material,
- Is moving slowly (≤ 10 kn),
- While there's a strong undercurrent (> 4 kn),
- And is trying to enter the Istanbul Strait,

**should never actually be inside the strait**.

The assertion `!((...) && ship1_in_strait)` catches violations of this rule by **forbidding the unsafe entry** scenario altogether.

Let me know if you'd like the same logic applied to ship2 or extended for multiple clauses!
