============= COMPLETE LLM OUTPUT =============
Here is the **Rebeca property file** that captures the semantics of the **Legata clause `Istanbul.Strait.Rule3.DangerousCargo`**:

---

### âœ… Rebeca Property File (for Timed Rebeca Simulation)

```rebeca
property {
    define {
        // Ship s1 represents OwnShip (OS)
        is_hazardous = (s1.contains_hazardous == true);
        current_strong = (theMap.undercurrent > 4);
        low_speed = (s1.ship_velocity <= 10);
        ship_in_strait = (theMap.ship1_inside_istanbul_strait == true);
    }

    Assertion {
        NoEntryIfHazardousInStrongCurrentAndSlow:
        !(is_hazardous && current_strong && low_speed && ship_in_strait);
    }
}
```

### ðŸ”Ž Semantic Meaning of the Legata Clause

**Clause Summary (Istanbul.Strait.Rule3.DangerousCargo):**

- If a ship is carrying *hazardous cargo* and the *undercurrent exceeds 4 knots*, then it must have a *speed greater than 10 knots* to be permitted to enter the strait.
- Otherwise, entry into the Istanbul Strait is prohibited for safety reasons.

### ðŸ§­ Mapping Legata â†’ Rebeca

| **Legata Clause Element**                        | **Mapped Rebeca Variable**                           | **Explanation** |
|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| `OS.Cargo in ['HazardousMaterial']`              | `s1.contains_hazardous == true`                      | Boolean state of whether the ship is carrying hazardous material |
| `OS.Undercurrent > kn(4)`                        | `theMap.undercurrent > 4`                            | Underwater current level monitored by the map server |
| `OS.Velocity > kn(10)`                           | `s1.ship_velocity > 10`                              | The required velocity condition to enter |
| **Violation Condition:** <br> `(hazardous && strong current && low speed)` | `!(...)` used in assertion to disallow violation | If this dangerous condition is met **and** the ship enters, it's a **violation** |

---

### âœ… Assertion Logic

The assertion **disallows** a situation where:
- The ship is **carrying hazardous cargo**
- The **undercurrent is strong** (> 4 kn)
- The ship is moving at **10 knots or less**
- And the ship is **inside the strait**

If all these conditions hold, that is a direct **violation** of the clause and should be **prevented or flagged** during simulation.

Let me know if you want this adapted for `s2` (another ship) or for multiple ships dynamically!

============= CRITERIA EVALUATION =============
Total points: 9/9

1. Is the syntax correct, so that we can run the proposed Rebeca property, without changes? (Yes=1p, No=0p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 1p

2. Are all relevant attributes included? (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p) (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p)
Answer: Yes
Points:3p

Ship:
ship_hazardous âœ…
ship_velocity âœ…

theMap:
ship_inside_istanbul_strait âœ…
undercurrent âœ…

3. Are correctness properties created for all relevant actors? (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor) (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor)
Answer: Yes
Points: 2p

4. Is the output code free from hallucinations (e.g. any irrelevant code added)? (1p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 1p

5. Is the logic correct? (2p (Full expression: 1p, Correct: 1p))
Answer: Full expression, Correct
Points: 2p
