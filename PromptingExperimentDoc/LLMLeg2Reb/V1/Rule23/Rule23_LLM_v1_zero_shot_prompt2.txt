### ✅ **Rebeca Property File (Assertion) for `COLREG.Rule23.d.i`**

```rebeca
property {
    define {
        IsPowerDriven = (s1.vessel_type_powerdriven == true);
        IsShortVessel = (s1.ship_length <= 12);
        AllroundLightOn = (s1.allround_light_on == true);
        SidelightOn = (s1.side_light_on == true);
    }

    Assertion {
        COLREG_Rule23_d_i: (IsPowerDriven && IsShortVessel && AllroundLightOn && SidelightOn);
    }
}
```

### 🔍 **Semantic Meaning of the Clause**

The Legata clause `COLREG.Rule23.d.i` captures a specific exemption for **power-driven vessels under 12 meters** in length. Instead of displaying the full set of navigational lights required under Rule 23(a), such vessels **may** show a simplified light configuration:
- An **all-round white light**, and
- **Sidelights**.

This exemption simplifies lighting requirements for smaller vessels that may lack the physical structure to support full lighting arrangements like dual masthead lights.

### 🧠 **Mapping Legata to Rebeca Property**

| **Legata Attribute**               | **Mapped Rebeca Attribute**      | **Explanation** |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| `OS.Type is Vessel.Type.PowerDriven` | `s1.vessel_type_powerdriven == true` | Indicates the vessel is power-driven. |
| `OS.Length > meters(12)` (exclude) | `s1.ship_length <= 12`            | The clause only applies to vessels **less than or equal to 12 meters**. |
| `OS.Signal.ON has 'Light.Allround.White'` | `s1.allround_light_on == true` | Ensures the vessel is showing an all-round white light. |
| `OS.Signal.ON has 'Light.Sidelight'` | `s1.side_light_on == true` | Ensures the sidelights are on. |

Note: The `exclude` in Legata is interpreted as an inverse condition, i.e., it excludes vessels **greater than** 12 meters, so we assert that the vessel is **less than or equal to** 12 meters in the property.
