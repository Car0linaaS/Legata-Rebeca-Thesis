============= COMPLETE LLM OUTPUT =============
Based on the **Legata clause** `COLREG.Rule23.d.i`, here's how we construct the corresponding **property file** in **Timed Rebeca syntax**, followed by a semantic explanation and mapping.

---

### ✅ **Rebeca Property File (COLREG.Rule23.d.i)**

```rebeca
property {
    define {
        PowerDriven = (vessel_type_powerdriven == true);
        Under12Meters = (ship_length < 12);
        AllroundWhiteOn = (allround_light_on == true);
        SideLightOn = (side_light_on == true);
    }

    Assertion {
        COLREG_Rule23_d_i: (PowerDriven && Under12Meters) == (AllroundWhiteOn && SideLightOn);
    }
}
```

---

### 💡 **Semantic Meaning of the Legata Clause (COLREG.Rule23.d.i)**

This clause applies to **power-driven vessels** that are **less than 12 meters in length** and describes an **alternative lighting requirement** when the vessel is **underway**. Specifically, such a vessel **may exhibit**:

- an **all-round white light**
- **sidelights**

in lieu of the standard lighting setup (e.g., masthead light, second masthead, sternlight, etc.).

However, the Legata clause makes this requirement **obligatory** (modeled as an "assure" clause), meaning that if a vessel is power-driven and under 12 meters, **then it must** have the all-round white light and sidelights on.

---

### 🔁 **Mapping from Legata Clause to Rebeca Property File**

| **Legata Attribute**                      | **Mapped Rebeca Variable**      | **Explanation** |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------|
| `OS.Type is Vessel.Type.PowerDriven`     | `vessel_type_powerdriven == true` | Vessel type flag |
| `OS.Length > meters(12)` (exclude clause)| `ship_length < 12`                | Inverted logic for exclusion |
| `OS.Signal.ON has 'Light.Allround.White'`| `allround_light_on == true`       | Light status variable |
| `OS.Signal.ON has 'Light.Sidelight'`     | `side_light_on == true`           | Light status variable |

> The Rebeca `Assertion` models the logic: **IF** the vessel is power-driven AND under 12 meters, **THEN** both the all-round white light AND sidelights **must** be on. If this is not the case, the assertion will fail during simulation.

Would you like to include a separate assertion for non-power-driven vessels or vessels ≥12 meters to explicitly check that this rule **doesn't apply** to them?
