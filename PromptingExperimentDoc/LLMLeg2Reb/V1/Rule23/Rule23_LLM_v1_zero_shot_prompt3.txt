============= COMPLETE LLM OUTPUT =============
Based on the **Legata clause** `COLREG.Rule23.d.i`, here's how we construct the corresponding **property file** in **Timed Rebeca syntax**, followed by a semantic explanation and mapping.

---

### ✅ **Rebeca Property File (COLREG.Rule23.d.i)**

```rebeca
property {
    define {
        PowerDriven = (vessel_type_powerdriven == true);
        Under12Meters = (ship_length < 12);
        AllroundWhiteOn = (allround_light_on == true);
        SideLightOn = (side_light_on == true);
    }

    Assertion {
        COLREG_Rule23_d_i: (PowerDriven && Under12Meters) == (AllroundWhiteOn && SideLightOn);
    }
}
```

---

### 💡 **Semantic Meaning of the Legata Clause (COLREG.Rule23.d.i)**

This clause applies to **power-driven vessels** that are **less than 12 meters in length** and describes an **alternative lighting requirement** when the vessel is **underway**. Specifically, such a vessel **may exhibit**:

- an **all-round white light**
- **sidelights**

in lieu of the standard lighting setup (e.g., masthead light, second masthead, sternlight, etc.).

However, the Legata clause makes this requirement **obligatory** (modeled as an "assure" clause), meaning that if a vessel is power-driven and under 12 meters, **then it must** have the all-round white light and sidelights on.

---

### 🔁 **Mapping from Legata Clause to Rebeca Property File**

| **Legata Attribute**                      | **Mapped Rebeca Variable**      | **Explanation** |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------|
| `OS.Type is Vessel.Type.PowerDriven`     | `vessel_type_powerdriven == true` | Vessel type flag |
| `OS.Length > meters(12)` (exclude clause)| `ship_length < 12`                | Inverted logic for exclusion |
| `OS.Signal.ON has 'Light.Allround.White'`| `allround_light_on == true`       | Light status variable |
| `OS.Signal.ON has 'Light.Sidelight'`     | `side_light_on == true`           | Light status variable |

> The Rebeca `Assertion` models the logic: **IF** the vessel is power-driven AND under 12 meters, **THEN** both the all-round white light AND sidelights **must** be on. If this is not the case, the assertion will fail during simulation.

Would you like to include a separate assertion for non-power-driven vessels or vessels ≥12 meters to explicitly check that this rule **doesn't apply** to them?

============= CRITERIA EVALUATION =============
Total points: 5/10

1. Is the syntax correct, so that we can run the proposed Rebeca property, without changes? (Yes=1p, No=0p)
Answer: No
Points: 0p

2. Are all relevant attributes included? (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p) (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p)
Answer: No
Points: 2p

Attributes:
Ship: [exists for ship]
vessel_type_powerdriven✅
shipunderway❌
ship_length ✅
allround_light_on ✅ 
side_light_on ✅

3. Are correctness properties created for all relevant actors? (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor) (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor)
Answer: Partially
Points: 1p

Note: Did not use s1.ship_length, only ship_length

4. Is the output code free from hallucinations (e.g. any irrelevant code added)? (1p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 1p

5. Is the logic correct? (3p (Correct: 2p, Partially correct: 1p) + (Full expression:1p))
Answer: Partially correct, Not full expression
Points: 1p
