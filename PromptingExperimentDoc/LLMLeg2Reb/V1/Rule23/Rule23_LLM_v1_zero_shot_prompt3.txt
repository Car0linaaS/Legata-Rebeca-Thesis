============= COMPLETE LLM OUTPUT =============
Hereâ€™s the **Rebeca property file** that captures the semantics of the provided **Legata clauses** from COLREG Rule 23 using Rebeca property syntax. After the property definitions, you'll find a full semantic explanation of the mapping between Legata and Rebeca.

### âœ… **Rebeca Property File**
```rebeca
property {
    define {
        isPowerDriven = (s1.vessel_type_powerdriven == true);
        isUnderway = (s1.underway == true);
        lengthLessThan12 = (s1.ship_length < 12);
        lengthLessThan50 = (s1.ship_length < 50);
        lengthGreaterThan12 = (s1.ship_length > 12);
        lengthGreaterOrEqual50 = (s1.ship_length >= 50);

        mastheadForwardOn = (s1.masthead_forward_light_on == true);
        mastheadAbaftOn = (s1.masthead_abaft_light_on == true);
        sideLightOn = (s1.side_light_on == true);
        sternLightOn = (s1.stern_light_on == true);
        allroundLightOn = (s1.allround_light_on == true);
    }

    Assertion {

        (mastheadForwardOn && sideLightOn && sternLightOn) &&
        (lengthLessThan50 || mastheadAbaftOn); // Optional if <50m, required if >=50m
    }

    Assertion {

### ðŸ“˜ **Explanation & Mapping from Legata to Rebeca**

#### **1. Legata Clause: `COLREG.Rule23.a`**
- **Legal Meaning**: A power-driven vessel that is *underway* and longer than 12m should show the following lights:
  - A masthead light forward.
  - A masthead light abaft (if â‰¥ 50m).
  - Sidelights.
  - Sternlight.
- **Rebeca Mapping**:
  - `s1.vessel_type_powerdriven == true` â†’ vessel is power-driven.
  - `s1.underway == true` â†’ vessel is underway.
  - `s1.ship_length > 12` â†’ excludes very small vessels.
  - Light signals are checked via booleans (e.g. `s1.masthead_forward_light_on`).
  - The abaft light is conditionally required depending on length (â‰¥50m required, <50m optional).

#### **2. Legata Clause: `COLREG.Rule23.a.ii`**
- **Legal Meaning**: Power-driven vessels â‰¥ 50m must have a second (abaft) masthead light.
- **Rebeca Mapping**:
  - Adds length restriction: `s1.ship_length >= 50`.
  - Ensures `s1.masthead_abaft_light_on == true`.

#### **3. Legata Clause: `COLREG.Rule23.d.i`**
- **Legal Meaning**: Vessels under 12m may substitute the full light set with an all-round white light and sidelights.
- **Rebeca Mapping**:
  - Condition: `s1.ship_length < 12`.
  - Lights: `s1.allround_light_on == true` and `s1.side_light_on == true`.

---

### ðŸ”„ **Note on Optional vs Mandatory**
- In `COLREG.Rule23.a`, the **second masthead light is optional** for vessels <50m, which is reflected in the assertion:
  - `lengthLessThan50 || mastheadAbaftOn` â†’ if it's less than 50m, it's okay if the abaft light is not on.

Let me know if you want these clauses applied to `s2` or for dynamic simulations like light violations during movement!

============= CRITERIA EVALUATION =============
Total points: 6/9

1. Is the syntax correct, so that we can run the proposed Rebeca property, without changes? (Yes=1p, No=0p)
Answer: No
Points: 0p

2. Are all relevant attributes included? (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p) (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 3p

Ship: [exists for ship1]
Underway âœ…
Powerdriven âœ…
ship_length_below/over_12 âœ…
ship_length_below/over_50 âœ…
Masthead_forward_on âœ…
Masthead_abaft_on âœ…
Sidelight_on âœ…
Sternlight_on âœ…
Allround_on âœ…

3. Are correctness properties created for all relevant actors? (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor) (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor)
Answer: Yes
Points: 2p

4. Is the output code free from hallucinations (e.g. any irrelevant code added)? (1p)
Answer: No
Points: 0p

Note: Multiple assertion blocks

5. Is the logic correct? (2p (Full expression: 1p, Correct: 1p) )
Answer: Full expression, not correct 
Points: 1p

Note: Rule 23.a, The logic is correct for when the ship is powerdriven, underway and above or equal to 12 metres in length.
The problem with that is that the assertion fails when there is a ship the rule itself shouldn't adhere to, e.g. less than 12 metres in length.

If implication would have been correct syntax, and it used implication instead of &&, it would have been correct.
(A && !B && C) && (E && G && H) would have to be (A && !B && C) -> (E && G && H)
(See prompt2)
