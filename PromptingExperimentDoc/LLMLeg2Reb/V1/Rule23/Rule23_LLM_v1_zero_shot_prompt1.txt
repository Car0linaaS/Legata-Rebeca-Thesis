Here is the **Rebeca property file** that models the **Legata clause `COLREG.Rule23.d.i`** for simulation using **Timed Rebeca**:

### 📜 Rebeca Property File
```rebeca
property {
    // Define the conditions of the clause
    define {
        IsPowerDriven = (s1.vessel_type_powerdriven == true);
        IsLengthLessThan12 = (s1.ship_length < 12);
        AllroundLightOn = (s1.allround_light_on == true);
        SideLightOn = (s1.side_light_on == true);
    }

    // Assertion: If vessel is power-driven and less than 12 meters, it must show an all-round white light and sidelights
    Assertion COLREG_Rule23_d_i_Compliance: (
        !(IsPowerDriven && IsLengthLessThan12) || (AllroundLightOn && SideLightOn)
    );
}
```

### 🧠 Semantic Explanation

#### 💡 **Intended Meaning of Legata Clause `COLREG.Rule23.d.i`**:
This clause defines **lighting requirements** for a **power-driven vessel** that is **less than 12 meters in length** and **underway** (i.e., not anchored or moored). 

Instead of showing all the standard lights (masthead, sidelights, sternlight), such vessels may comply by simply showing:
- An **all-round white light**, and
- **Sidelights**.

#### 🔄 **Mapping Legata to Rebeca Property**:

| Legata Concept | Mapped to Rebeca Variable | Description |
|----------------|----------------------------|-------------|
| `OS.Type is Vessel.Type.PowerDriven` | `s1.vessel_type_powerdriven == true` | Own Ship (s1) is power-driven |
| `OS.Length > meters(12)` (in exclude) | `s1.ship_length < 12` | Vessel must be **less** than 12 meters |
| `OS.Signal.ON has 'Light.Allround.White'` | `s1.allround_light_on == true` | All-round white light is turned on |
| `OS.Signal.ON has 'Light.Sidelight'` | `s1.side_light_on == true` | Sidelights are turned on |

#### ⚖️ Assertion Logic:
- The assertion ensures that **if** the vessel is power-driven and under 12 meters, **then** both the all-round white light and sidelights must be on.
- If the vessel **does not meet** these conditions (e.g., is not power-driven or is longer than 12m), the lighting rule doesn’t apply — hence the logical **OR** condition (`!precondition || compliance`).

Let me know if you want to cover additional clauses, or adapt this to a different vessel (`s2`) or extend for simulation testing!

============= CRITERIA EVALUATION =============
Total points: 7/10

1. Is the syntax correct, so that we can run the proposed Rebeca property, without changes? (Yes=1p, No=0p)
Answer: No
Points: 0p

2. Are all relevant attributes included? (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p) (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p)
Answer: No
Points: 2p

Attributes:
Ship: [exists for ship]
vessel_type_powerdriven✅
shipunderway❌
ship_length ✅
allround_light_on ✅ 
side_light_on ✅


3. Are correctness properties created for all relevant actors? (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor) (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor)
Answer: Yes 
Points: 2p

4. Is the output code free from hallucinations (e.g. any irrelevant code added)? (1p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 1p

5. Is the logic correct? (3p (Correct: 2p, Partially correct: 1p) + (Full expression:1p))
Answer: Correct, Not full expression
Points: 2p

Note: It checks for less than 12 metres, which misses exactly 12 metres
