### ðŸ“˜ Explanation of the Legata Clause and Mapping

**Legata Clause:**  
`clause['IstanbulStrait.Clause.1']` describes a rule applicable to a ship (`OwnShip`) navigating in or near a **Traffic Zone** in the Istanbul Strait.  

- **Condition:**  
  The ship is within a *near* proximity to a traffic zone (`Map.Sea@TrafficZone].Distance in Area.Near.ProximityRange`). This is interpreted in Rebeca as `shipX_inside_traffic_zone == true`, for either `s1` or `s2`.

- **Assure:**  
  If that condition is met, then the shipâ€™s **visibility range** must be greater than 0.5 nautical miles (converted to model scale as `kn(.5)` â†’ `0.5`).

### ðŸ”„ Mapping from Legata to Rebeca

| Legata Attribute                            | Rebeca Equivalent                    | Description |
|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------|
| `OwnShip` (`OS`)                             | `s1` and `s2`                        | Representing each ship actor |
| `Map.Sea@TrafficZone.Distance âˆˆ Near`       | `shipX_inside_traffic_zone == true` | Boolean flags in `MapServer` |
| `OS.Visibility.Range > kn(.5)`              | `sX.vis_range > 0.5`                | Visibility constraint |

---

### ðŸ§  Semantics of the Property

These **assertions** state that:
- **If** a ship is near a traffic zone, **then** its visibility range **must** be greater than 0.5.
- If it's *not* near a traffic zone, the rule does not apply (i.e., the clause is trivially satisfied).

This is modeled using `!(condition) || assure`, which is equivalent to logical implication without using the `->` operator.

Let me know if you want to extend this to more clauses or include other contextual factors like direction, speed, or right-of-way rules.
