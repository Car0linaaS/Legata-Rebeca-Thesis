============= COMPLETE LLM OUTPUT =============
Here is the **Rebeca property file** based on the provided **Legata clause**:

---

### ✅ **Rebeca Property File**
```rebeca
property {
    define {
        ownShip_near_traffic_zone = (theMap.ship1_inside_traffic_zone == true);
        ownShip_vis_range_high_enough = (s1.vis_range > 0.5);
    }

    Assertion {
        IstanbulStrait_Clause1_Compliance: ( !ownShip_near_traffic_zone || ownShip_vis_range_high_enough );
    }
}
```

---

### 🔍 **Semantic Meaning (Natural Language)**

This clause represents a rule from the **COLREGs** applicable in or near the **Istanbul Strait's Traffic Separation Zone**. It essentially states:

> **If** a ship (the "OwnShip") is within **proximity** to a **Traffic Zone**, then it must ensure that its **visibility range** is **greater than 0.5 nautical miles**.

This rule ensures that any vessel operating close to critical traffic areas like the Istanbul Strait maintains an adequate visibility range—likely for safety, navigation, and compliance reasons.

### 🧠 **Mapping Legata to Rebeca**

| **Legata Component** | **Explanation** | **Rebeca Mapping** |
|----------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| `OS` | OwnShip | `s1` (assumed OwnShip is Ship 1) |
| `Map.Sea@TrafficZone.Distance in Area.Near.ProximityRange` | Indicates the ship is near the Traffic Zone | `theMap.ship1_inside_traffic_zone == true` |
| `OS.Visibility.Range > kn(.5)` | Visibility range of ship must be over 0.5 nm | `s1.vis_range > 0.5` |

### 🛑 Why No Implication?

Rebeca’s property specification doesn’t support implication (→), so we express:

```
if A then B
```
as:
```
!A || B
```

Which logically achieves the same outcome.

Would you like to include the same clause for `s2` (another ship) as well?
