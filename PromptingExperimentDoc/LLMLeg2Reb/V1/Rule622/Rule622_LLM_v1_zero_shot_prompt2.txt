### âœ… Rebeca Property File Representation

```rebeca
property {
    define {
        OwnShip_Near_TrafficZone = (theMap.ship1_inside_traffic_zone == true);
        OwnShip_Visibility_High = (s1.vis_range > 0.5);
    }

    Assertion {
        IstanbulStrait_Clause_1_Compliance: 
        (!OwnShip_Near_TrafficZone) || (OwnShip_Visibility_High);
    }
}
```

### ðŸ“˜ Semantic Meaning of the Legata Clause

#### Clause Summary:
The clause `IstanbulStrait.Clause.1` enforces a regulation for a vessel (denoted as `OwnShip`, or `OS`) operating near a **Traffic Separation Zone** (in this case, within the **Istanbul Strait**). Specifically, it states:

> **If the ship is within a near proximity of the traffic zone**, then **it must have a visibility range greater than 0.5 nautical miles**.

This regulation ensures that any vessel operating close to a regulated or potentially congested area like a traffic separation scheme has adequate visibility to maintain safe navigation and collision avoidance.

### ðŸ§  Mapping Legata Concepts to Rebeca Model

| **Legata Concept**                                      | **Rebeca Variable / Mapping**                               |
|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `OwnShip` (OS)                                           | `s1` (we assume s1 is the "own ship")                        |
| `Map.Sea@TrafficZone.Distance in Area.Near.ProximityRange` | `theMap.ship1_inside_traffic_zone == true`                   |
| `OS.Visibility.Range > kn(0.5)`                          | `s1.vis_range > 0.5` (unit assumed consistent with kn)       |

> Note: Since the clause checks for proximity to a specific zone (`TrafficZone`), we interpret this as a boolean value in the simulation model (`ship1_inside_traffic_zone`). The unit `kn(0.5)` (nautical miles) is translated directly into a threshold value in the Rebeca property.

Let me know if you'd like to adapt this clause for `s2` (the other ship) or generalize it further!

============= CRITERIA EVALUATION =============
Total points: 10/10

1. Is the syntax correct, so that we can run the proposed Rebeca property, without changes? (Yes=1p, No=0p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 1p

2. Are all relevant attributes included? (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p) (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 3p

Ship:
vis_range âœ…

theMap:
ship_inside_traffic_zone âœ…

3. Are correctness properties created for all relevant actors? (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor) (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor)
Answer: Yes
Points: 2p

4. Is the output code free from hallucinations (e.g. any irrelevant code added)? (1p) (1p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 1p

5. Is the logic correct? (3p (Correct: 2p, Partially correct: 1p) + (Full expression:1p))
Answer: Correct, Full expression
Points: 3p

Note: The response uses 0.5 nautical miles, while we have converted to metres. ChatGPT is more correct than we are in this case.
