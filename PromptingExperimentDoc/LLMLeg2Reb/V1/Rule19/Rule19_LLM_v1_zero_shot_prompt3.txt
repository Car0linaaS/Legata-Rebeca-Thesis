============= COMPLETE LLM OUTPUT =============
Based on the provided Legata clause `COLREG.Rule19.b`, here's how the **Rebeca property file** would be constructed to represent this regulation:

---

### ✅ **Rebeca Property File (Assertion Only)**

```rebeca
property {
    define {
        IsPowerDriven = (s1.vessel_type_powerdriven == true);
        IsEngineOn = (s1.engine_on == true);
        IsInRestrictedVisibility = (s1.restricted_visibility == true);
        IsSpeedSafe = (s1.ship_velocity <= theMap.speed_safe_range);
    }

    Assertion {
        COLREG_Rule19b_Compliance: !(IsPowerDriven && IsInRestrictedVisibility && IsSpeedSafe) || IsEngineOn;
    }
}
```

---

### 🧭 **Semantic Explanation of the Legata Clause and Mapping**

---

#### 🔹 **Legata Clause Meaning (COLREG Rule 19.b)**:

This clause is about **vessels operating in or near areas of restricted visibility**, and it applies specifically when:

- Vessels are **not in sight of each other**.
- A **power-driven vessel** is navigating.
- The vessel is navigating **at a safe speed** appropriate for restricted visibility conditions.
  
Under these conditions, **the vessel's engines must be ready for immediate maneuver**, which is interpreted as **"engine must be ON."**

---

#### 🔹 **Mapping from Legata to Rebeca Property Variables**

| **Legata Concept**                                                | **Mapped Rebeca Variable**                  | **Comment**                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `OS.Type is Vessel.Type.PowerDriven`                             | `s1.vessel_type_powerdriven == true`       | Checks if the vessel is power-driven                                       |
| `OS.Speed in Vessel.RestrictedVisibility.Speed.Safe.Range`       | `s1.ship_velocity <= theMap.speed_safe_range` | Ensures vessel speed is within safe limits during restricted visibility    |
| `OS.Engine.State in ['Vessel.Engine.ON']`                        | `s1.engine_on == true`                     | Asserts that the engine is ON (ready for maneuver)                         |
| Navigating in restricted visibility                              | `s1.restricted_visibility == true`         | Boolean flag showing current restricted visibility condition               |

---

### 🧩 **How the Assertion Works**

The assertion:

```rebeca
!(IsPowerDriven && IsInRestrictedVisibility && IsSpeedSafe) || IsEngineOn;
```

translates to:

- If the vessel **is a power-driven vessel**, **in restricted visibility**, and **going at a safe speed**,  
  → then it **must have the engine ON**.

If this **condition is not met**, the assertion fails, representing a **violation of COLREG Rule 19(b)**.

Let me know if you want to model the “visibility” clause from part (a) as well or simulate both ships!
