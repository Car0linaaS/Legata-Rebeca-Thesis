============= COMPLETE LLM OUTPUT =============
Based on the provided Legata clause `COLREG.Rule19.b`, here's how the **Rebeca property file** would be constructed to represent this regulation:

---

### ✅ **Rebeca Property File (Assertion Only)**

```rebeca
property {
    define {
        IsPowerDriven = (s1.vessel_type_powerdriven == true);
        IsEngineOn = (s1.engine_on == true);
        IsInRestrictedVisibility = (s1.restricted_visibility == true);
        IsSpeedSafe = (s1.ship_velocity <= theMap.speed_safe_range);
    }

    Assertion {
        COLREG_Rule19b_Compliance: !(IsPowerDriven && IsInRestrictedVisibility && IsSpeedSafe) || IsEngineOn;
    }
}
```

---

### 🧭 **Semantic Explanation of the Legata Clause and Mapping**

---

#### 🔹 **Legata Clause Meaning (COLREG Rule 19.b)**:

This clause is about **vessels operating in or near areas of restricted visibility**, and it applies specifically when:

- Vessels are **not in sight of each other**.
- A **power-driven vessel** is navigating.
- The vessel is navigating **at a safe speed** appropriate for restricted visibility conditions.
  
Under these conditions, **the vessel's engines must be ready for immediate maneuver**, which is interpreted as **"engine must be ON."**

---

#### 🔹 **Mapping from Legata to Rebeca Property Variables**

| **Legata Concept**                                                | **Mapped Rebeca Variable**                  | **Comment**                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `OS.Type is Vessel.Type.PowerDriven`                             | `s1.vessel_type_powerdriven == true`       | Checks if the vessel is power-driven                                       |
| `OS.Speed in Vessel.RestrictedVisibility.Speed.Safe.Range`       | `s1.ship_velocity <= theMap.speed_safe_range` | Ensures vessel speed is within safe limits during restricted visibility    |
| `OS.Engine.State in ['Vessel.Engine.ON']`                        | `s1.engine_on == true`                     | Asserts that the engine is ON (ready for maneuver)                         |
| Navigating in restricted visibility                              | `s1.restricted_visibility == true`         | Boolean flag showing current restricted visibility condition               |

---

### 🧩 **How the Assertion Works**

The assertion:

```rebeca
!(IsPowerDriven && IsInRestrictedVisibility && IsSpeedSafe) || IsEngineOn;
```

translates to:

- If the vessel **is a power-driven vessel**, **in restricted visibility**, and **going at a safe speed**,  
  → then it **must have the engine ON**.

If this **condition is not met**, the assertion fails, representing a **violation of COLREG Rule 19(b)**.

Let me know if you want to model the “visibility” clause from part (a) as well or simulate both ships!

============= CRITERIA EVALUATION =============
Total points: 4/9

1. Is the syntax correct, so that we can run the proposed Rebeca property, without changes? (Yes=1p, No=0p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 1p

2. Are all relevant attributes included? (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p)
Answer: No
Points: 1p

Ship: [exists for ship1] [exists for ship2]
Restricted_visibility ✅❌
Vessel_type_powerdriven✅❌
Ship_velocity✅❌
engine_on✅❌
theMap:
Speed_safe_range✅❌
Ships_close❌

3. Are correctness properties created for all relevant actors? (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor)
Answer: No
Points: 1p
Only for s1 and theMap

4. Is the output code free from hallucinations (e.g. any irrelevant code added)? (1p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 1p

Answer: Not correct, not full expression
Points: 0p

!(D && B && E) || F

============= COMMENT =============
Two ships needed to fully check correct properties, e.g. ChatGPTs property misses out on when the ship outside fog goes too fast even though it is close to the ship inside fog

s1: (!shipsClose || !(ship1restrictedVisibility || ship2restrictedVisibility)) || (!ship1isPowerdriven || ship1safeSpeedLowVis && ship1engineOn);
(!A || !(B || C)) || (!D || E && F)
shipsClose = A
ship1restrictedVisibility = B
ship2restrictedVisibility = C
ship1isPowerdriven = D
ship1safeSpeedLowVis = E
ship1engineOn = F
