### ✅ **Rebeca Property File for `COLREG.Rule19.b`**

```rebeca
property {
    define {
        IsPowerDriven = (s1.vessel_type_powerdriven == true);
        IsInSafeSpeedRange = (s1.ship_velocity <= theMap.speed_safe_range);
        IsEngineOn = (s1.engine_on == true);
        IsRestrictedVisibility = (s1.restricted_visibility == true);
        ShipsClose = (theMap.ships_close_to_each_other == true);
    }

    // Assertion: A power-driven vessel in restricted visibility must have engine on and proceed at a safe speed
    Assertion Rule19b_Compliance: (
        (!IsRestrictedVisibility || !IsPowerDriven || !ShipsClose) || 
        (IsInSafeSpeedRange && IsEngineOn)
    );
}
```

### 🔍 **Semantic Explanation of Legata Clause → Rebeca Property Mapping**

---

#### 💡 **Clause Context – Rule 19**

This rule governs vessels **not in sight of one another** and navigating in or near areas of **restricted visibility** (e.g., fog, heavy rain). The primary concern is collision prevention in low-visibility conditions.

---

### 🧠 **Semantic Mapping**

| Legata Component | Rebeca Mapping | Explanation |
|------------------|----------------|-------------|
| `OS.Type is Vessel.Type.PowerDriven` | `s1.vessel_type_powerdriven == true` | Checks if the ship (`s1`) is a power-driven vessel |
| `OS.Speed in Vessel.RestrictedVisibility.Speed.Safe.Range` | `s1.ship_velocity <= theMap.speed_safe_range` | Verifies if the speed is within the safe range defined by the map server |
| `OS.Engine.State in ['Vessel.Engine.ON']` | `s1.engine_on == true` | Confirms that the engine is ON (ready for immediate manoeuvre) |
| `Map.Sky@RestrictedVisibility` | `s1.restricted_visibility == true` | Indicates that restricted visibility conditions exist in the ship's environment |
| `Distance in Area.Near.SafeRange` | `theMap.ships_close_to_each_other == true` | Simplified in Rebeca as a boolean flag showing ships are close and need to consider Rule 19 |

---

### ⚙️ **Assertion Logic**

- We **only enforce Rule 19(b)** if all these are true:
  - Restricted visibility exists.
  - The vessel is power-driven.
  - Another ship is close (meaning we are "navigating in or near").

- Then we **assert** that:
  - The vessel is moving at a safe speed.
  - The engine is ON.

- If the rule **does not apply**, we don’t enforce the requirement (`!IsRestrictedVisibility || !IsPowerDriven || !ShipsClose`).

---

Let me know if you want the assertion to apply to both `s1` and `s2`, or want a version with more detailed scenario modeling.

============= CRITERIA EVALUATION =============
Total points: 4/9

1. Is the syntax correct, so that we can run the proposed Rebeca property, without changes? (Yes=1p, No=0p)
Answer: No
Points: 0p

2. Are all relevant attributes included? (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p)
Answer: No
Points: 1p

Ship: [exists for ship1] [exists for ship2]
Restricted_visibility ✅❌
Vessel_type_powerdriven✅❌
Ship_velocity✅❌
engine_on✅❌
theMap: [exists for ship1] [exists for ship2]
Speed_safe_range✅❌
Ships_close✅

3. Are correctness properties created for all relevant actors? (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor)
Answer: No
Points: 1p

Only for s1 and theMap

4. Is the output code free from hallucinations (e.g. any irrelevant code added)? (1p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 1p

5. Is the logic correct? (2p (Full expression: 1p, Correct: 1p))
Answer: Not full expression, Correct
Points: 1p

Correct for what's included

((!B || !D || !A) || (E && F))

============= COMMENT =============
Two ships needed to fully check correct properties, e.g. ChatGPTs property misses out on when the ship outside fog goes too fast even though it is close to the ship inside fog

After adding {} it works as expected for scenario
