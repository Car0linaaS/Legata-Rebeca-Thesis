### ✅ **Rebeca Property File for `COLREG.Rule19.b`**

```rebeca
property {
    define {
        IsPowerDriven = (s1.vessel_type_powerdriven == true);
        IsInSafeSpeedRange = (s1.ship_velocity <= theMap.speed_safe_range);
        IsEngineOn = (s1.engine_on == true);
        IsRestrictedVisibility = (s1.restricted_visibility == true);
        ShipsClose = (theMap.ships_close_to_each_other == true);
    }

    // Assertion: A power-driven vessel in restricted visibility must have engine on and proceed at a safe speed
    Assertion Rule19b_Compliance: (
        (!IsRestrictedVisibility || !IsPowerDriven || !ShipsClose) || 
        (IsInSafeSpeedRange && IsEngineOn)
    );
}
```

### 🔍 **Semantic Explanation of Legata Clause → Rebeca Property Mapping**

---

#### 💡 **Clause Context – Rule 19**

This rule governs vessels **not in sight of one another** and navigating in or near areas of **restricted visibility** (e.g., fog, heavy rain). The primary concern is collision prevention in low-visibility conditions.

---

### 🧠 **Semantic Mapping**

| Legata Component | Rebeca Mapping | Explanation |
|------------------|----------------|-------------|
| `OS.Type is Vessel.Type.PowerDriven` | `s1.vessel_type_powerdriven == true` | Checks if the ship (`s1`) is a power-driven vessel |
| `OS.Speed in Vessel.RestrictedVisibility.Speed.Safe.Range` | `s1.ship_velocity <= theMap.speed_safe_range` | Verifies if the speed is within the safe range defined by the map server |
| `OS.Engine.State in ['Vessel.Engine.ON']` | `s1.engine_on == true` | Confirms that the engine is ON (ready for immediate manoeuvre) |
| `Map.Sky@RestrictedVisibility` | `s1.restricted_visibility == true` | Indicates that restricted visibility conditions exist in the ship's environment |
| `Distance in Area.Near.SafeRange` | `theMap.ships_close_to_each_other == true` | Simplified in Rebeca as a boolean flag showing ships are close and need to consider Rule 19 |

---

### ⚙️ **Assertion Logic**

- We **only enforce Rule 19(b)** if all these are true:
  - Restricted visibility exists.
  - The vessel is power-driven.
  - Another ship is close (meaning we are "navigating in or near").

- Then we **assert** that:
  - The vessel is moving at a safe speed.
  - The engine is ON.

- If the rule **does not apply**, we don’t enforce the requirement (`!IsRestrictedVisibility || !IsPowerDriven || !ShipsClose`).

---

Let me know if you want the assertion to apply to both `s1` and `s2`, or want a version with more detailed scenario modeling.
