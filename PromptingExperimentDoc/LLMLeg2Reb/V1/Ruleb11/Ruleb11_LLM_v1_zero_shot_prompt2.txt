### ✅ **Rebeca Property File**
```rebeca
property {
    define {
        IsLargeLength = (s1.ship_length > 150);
        IsDeepDraught = (s1.ship_draught > 10);
        IsStrongUndercurrent = (theMap.undercurrent > 4);
        IsHighVelocity = (s1.ship_velocity > 10);
    }

    Assertion {
        Istanbul_Strait_Rule3_LargeVessel_Assertion: 
        ((IsLargeLength && IsStrongUndercurrent) || (IsDeepDraught && IsStrongUndercurrent)) 
        && IsHighVelocity;
    }
}
```

### 🧠 Semantic Explanation

#### 📜 **Intended Meaning of the Legata Clause**
This clause from Legata (`Istanbul.Strait.Rule3.LargeVessel`) describes a regulation that applies to large vessels navigating through the Istanbul Strait under strong undercurrent conditions. It enforces a **minimum speed** requirement for vessels that meet **either of two conditions**:

1. **Condition 1**: The vessel is longer than 150 meters and the undercurrent is stronger than 4 knots.
2. **Condition 2**: The vessel has a draught deeper than 10 meters and the undercurrent is stronger than 4 knots.

➡️ **Assure**: If either of the above conditions is met, the ship must travel faster than 10 knots.

### 🔄 Mapping Legata → Rebeca

| Legata Attribute        | Rebeca Mapping                       | Notes |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------|
| `OS.Length > 150`       | `s1.ship_length > 150`              | OwnShip is mapped to `s1` |
| `OS.Draught > 10`       | `s1.ship_draught > 10`              | Depth of the vessel |
| `OS.Undercurrent > 4`   | `theMap.undercurrent > 4`           | Undercurrent measured by `MapServer` |
| `OS.Velocity > 10`      | `s1.ship_velocity > 10`             | Required assured condition |

Let me know if you'd like this adjusted for `s2` as the own ship, or want to incorporate this into a full Rebeca simulation scenario.
