============= COMPLETE LLM OUTPUT =============
Here is the **Rebeca property file** that represents the Legata clause `Istanbul.Strait.Rule3.LargeVessel`:

```rebeca
property {
    define {
        isLargeVessel = (s1.ship_length > 150);
        isDeepDraught = (s1.ship_draught > 10);
        strongUndercurrent = (theMap.undercurrent > 4);
        isSlow = (s1.ship_velocity <= 10);
        inStrait = (theMap.ship1_inside_istanbul_strait == true);
    }

    Assertion {
        Istanbul_Strait_Rule3_LargeVessel: !(
            ((isLargeVessel && strongUndercurrent && isSlow && inStrait) ||
             (isDeepDraught && strongUndercurrent && isSlow && inStrait))
        );
    }
}
```

### âœ… Semantic Meaning of the Clause

**Legata Clause Summary**:  
This clause expresses a regulation for navigating the Istanbul Strait. If a vessel is considered a **large vessel** (length > 150m) **or** has a **deep draught** (draught > 10m), and the **undercurrent in the strait exceeds 4 knots**, then that vessel **must not enter the strait unless it is moving faster than 10 knots**.

### ðŸ”„ Mapping Legata Attributes to Rebeca

| **Legata Element** | **Rebeca Mapping** | **Explanation** |
|-------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| `OS.Length > meters(150)` | `s1.ship_length > 150` | Checks for large vessel |
| `OS.Draught > meters(10)` | `s1.ship_draught > 10` | Checks for deep draught |
| `OS.Undercurrent > kn(4)` | `theMap.undercurrent > 4` | Sea current condition |
| `OS.Velocity > kn(10)` | `s1.ship_velocity > 10` | Assured speed requirement |
| **Combined logic** | Assertion in property | Models prohibition of entry unless >10 kn |

The `Assertion` ensures that **a violation of the rule (being in the strait while being large/deep, slow, and facing strong current)** must **never** happen. That is, if all those conditions are true simultaneously, the system violates the COLREG regulation described.

Let me know if youâ€™d like to extend this to include `s2` or add another rule!

============= CRITERIA EVALUATION =============
Total points: 10/10

1. Is the syntax correct, so that we can run the proposed Rebeca property, without changes? (Yes=1p, No=0p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 1p

2. Are all relevant attributes included? (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p) (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 3p

Ship:
ship_length âœ…
ship_draught âœ…
ship_velocity âœ…

theMap:
ship_inside_istanbul_strait âœ…

3. Are correctness properties created for all relevant actors? (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor) (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor)
Answer: Yes
Points: 2p

4. Is the output code free from hallucinations (e.g. any irrelevant code added)? (1p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 1p

5. Is the logic correct? (3p (Correct: 2p, Partially correct: 1p) + (Full expression:1p))
Answer: Correct, Full expression
Points: 3p

============= COMMENT =============
Our:
!A || B || !C || !(D || E)

Those varables based on our property file:
ship1InsideIstanbulStrait = A
ship1isFastEnough = B
undercurrentsAboveLimit = C
ship1isOverLengthLimit = D
ship1isOverDraughtLimit = E

Response:
!((A && !B && C && D) || (A && !B && C && E))
