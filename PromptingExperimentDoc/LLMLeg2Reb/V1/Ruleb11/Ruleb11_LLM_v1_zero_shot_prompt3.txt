============= COMPLETE LLM OUTPUT =============
Here's the **Rebeca property file** that represents the Legata clause `Istanbul.Strait.Rule3.LargeVessel`:

```rebeca
property {
	define {
		Ship1_IsLarge = (s1.ship_length > 150);
		Ship1_IsDeepDraught = (s1.ship_draught > 10);
		Strong_Undercurrent = (theMap.undercurrent > 4);
		Ship1_SpeedLow = (s1.ship_velocity <= 10);
	}

	Assertion {
		StraitEntryRestriction: !(
			( (Ship1_IsLarge && Strong_Undercurrent && Ship1_SpeedLow) ||
			  (Ship1_IsDeepDraught && Strong_Undercurrent && Ship1_SpeedLow)
			)
		);
	}
}
```

### ✅ **Semantic Explanation of the Legata Clause**

The Legata clause `Istanbul.Strait.Rule3.LargeVessel` imposes restrictions based on vessel attributes and environmental conditions:

> **"If the sea current exceeds 4 knots, then large vessels (length > 150m), deep-draught vessels (draught > 10m), or vessels carrying hazardous cargo traveling at 10 knots or less may not enter the Istanbul Strait."**

Since the clause doesn't mention hazardous cargo separately in its conditions, and we’re modeling only what's present, we focus on:
- **Ship size** (length > 150 meters)
- **Ship draught** (draught > 10 meters)
- **Sea current** (undercurrent > 4 knots)
- **Ship velocity** (must be > 10 knots to enter)

### 🧩 **How Conditions Map to Rebeca Property Variables**

| **Legata Attribute**             | **Mapped Rebeca Variable / Expression**            |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `OS.Length > meters(150)`        | `s1.ship_length > 150`                              |
| `OS.Draught > meters(10)`        | `s1.ship_draught > 10`                              |
| `OS.Undercurrent > kn(4)`        | `theMap.undercurrent > 4`                           |
| `OS.Velocity > kn(10)`           | `s1.ship_velocity > 10`                             |

The **assertion** ensures that:
- If the ship is large or deep-draught **and** the undercurrent is strong **and** the ship is going slow (≤10 knots), **then** the situation is invalid — hence we **negate it** with `!`.

This property enforces compliance with Rule 3 by asserting that such ships **should not be present in the simulation** under those conditions.

Want this adapted for `s2` or both ships at once too?

============= CRITERIA EVALUATION =============
Total points: 7/9

1. Is the syntax correct, so that we can run the proposed Rebeca property, without changes? (Yes=1p, No=0p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 1p

2. Are all relevant attributes included? (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p) (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p)
Answer: Partially
Points: 2p

Ship:
ship_length ✅
ship_draught ✅
ship_velocity ✅

theMap:
ship_inside_istanbul_strait ❌
undercurrent ✅

3. Are correctness properties created for all relevant actors? (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor) (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor)
Answer: Yes
Points: 2p

4. Is the output code free from hallucinations (e.g. any irrelevant code added)? (1p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 1p

5. Is the logic correct? (2p (Full expression: 1p, Correct: 1p))
Answer: Not full expression, Correct
Points: 1p

Note: Misses out on checking if vessel is inside the strait or not

Our:
!A || B || !C || !(D || E)

Those varables based on our property file:
ship1InsideIstanbulStrait = A
ship1isFastEnough = B
undercurrentsAboveLimit = C
