============= COMPLETE LLM OUTPUT =============
Here's how the Legata clause `Istanbul.Strait.Rule3.LargeVessel` can be translated into a Rebeca property file:

---

### ✅ **Rebeca Property File:**

```rebeca
property {
    define {
        isLargeShip1 = (s1.ship_length > 150);
        isDeepDraughtShip1 = (s1.ship_draught > 10);
        strongUndercurrent = (theMap.undercurrent > 4);
        ship1IsFast = (s1.ship_velocity > 10);
    }

    Assertion {
        Istanbul_Strait_Rule3_LargeVessel_Ship1:
        (!((isLargeShip1 && strongUndercurrent) || (isDeepDraughtShip1 && strongUndercurrent)) || ship1IsFast);
    }
}
```

### ✅ **Semantic Explanation of the Legata Clause:**

#### **Legata Clause: `Istanbul.Strait.Rule3.LargeVessel`**
This clause models a maritime safety regulation applicable in the Istanbul Strait. It targets vessels that either:
- Are large (length > 150 meters) **and** sailing in strong undercurrents (> 4 knots), **or**
- Have a deep draught (> 10 meters) **and** are also in strong undercurrents.

In either case, if **any** of those conditions are true, the **vessel must be moving faster than 10 knots**. This likely serves a navigational or safety purpose, possibly to ensure maneuverability or to avoid drifting due to current.

---

### ✅ **Mapping Legata Clause to Rebeca Properties:**

| Legata Concept | Rebeca Mapping | Description |
|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| `OS.Length > meters(150)` | `s1.ship_length > 150` | Check if the ship is a large vessel. |
| `OS.Draught > meters(10)` | `s1.ship_draught > 10` | Check if the ship has a deep draught. |
| `OS.Undercurrent > kn(4)` | `theMap.undercurrent > 4` | Check if the environmental condition includes strong undercurrents. |
| `OS.Velocity > kn(10)` | `s1.ship_velocity > 10` | Assures that the vessel's speed is sufficient if conditions are met. |

---

### ✅ **Assertion Logic Explanation:**
We use logical expression transformation here:  
The Legata clause expresses **"If condition(s), then assure"**.

Since Rebeca properties **do not support implication (`->`)**, we write it using logical equivalence:  
**`(condition -> assure)` becomes `(!condition || assure)`**.

So we transform:
```
((isLarge && currentStrong) || (isDeep && currentStrong)) -> isFast
```
into:
```
!(...) || isFast
```

Let me know if you want to do this for `s2` as well, or if you’d like to generate clauses for multiple ships together!

============= CRITERIA EVALUATION =============
Total points: x/10

1. Is the syntax correct, so that we can run the proposed Rebeca property, without changes? (Yes=1p, No=0p)
Answer: 

2. Are all relevant attributes included? (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p) (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p)
Answer: 
Points:

3. Are correctness properties created for all relevant actors? (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor) (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor)
Answer: 
Points:

4. Is the output code free from hallucinations (e.g. any irrelevant code added)? (1p) (1p)
Answer: 
Points:
