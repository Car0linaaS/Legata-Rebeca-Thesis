Here’s the **Rebeca property file** based on the provided **Legata clause**:

### 🛠 **Rebeca Property File**
```rebeca
property {
    define {
        LargeVesselCondition1 = (s1.ship_length > 150) && (theMap.undercurrent > 4);
        LargeVesselCondition2 = (s1.ship_draught > 10) && (theMap.undercurrent > 4);
    }

    Assertion {
        Istanbul_Strait_Rule3_LargeVessel: !( (LargeVesselCondition1 || LargeVesselCondition2) && (s1.ship_velocity <= 10) );
    }
}
```

### 🧠 **Explanation of Semantic Mapping**

#### 📘 **Legata Clause Meaning**
The **Legata clause `Istanbul.Strait.Rule3.LargeVessel`** enforces a rule from the **Istanbul Strait protocol**. It prohibits certain types of vessels from entering the strait when sea currents exceed a specific speed. Specifically:
- If a vessel is:
  - A **large vessel** (longer than 150 meters), or
  - A **deep-draught vessel** (draught greater than 10 meters),
- AND the **undercurrent** exceeds **4 knots**,
- THEN that vessel must be traveling faster than **10 knots** to be allowed entry into the strait.

This regulation aims to reduce navigation hazards in narrow or strong-current environments like the Istanbul Strait.

#### 🔁 **Mapping from Legata to Rebeca**
| Legata Attribute              | Rebeca Variable            | Explanation |
|------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------|
| `OS.Length > meters(150)`    | `s1.ship_length > 150`     | Own Ship is modeled as `s1`; length over 150 meters. |
| `OS.Draught > meters(10)`    | `s1.ship_draught > 10`     | Deep draught vessel. |
| `OS.Undercurrent > kn(4)`    | `theMap.undercurrent > 4`  | The undercurrent value comes from the `MapServer`. |
| `OS.Velocity > kn(10)`       | `s1.ship_velocity > 10`    | The required minimum velocity to enter the strait. |

---

#### ✅ **Assertion Logic**
We want to assert that **if** a ship is subject to either of the two risk conditions (length or draught + undercurrent), **then** it must be going faster than 10 knots.

But since implication (`->`) is not allowed, we negate the **undesired case**:
- It's **not okay** if a ship **meets the risky condition** but **is moving ≤ 10 knots**.

So we define:
```text
!( (Condition1 || Condition2) && (Velocity ≤ 10) )
```
This ensures: **"If the ship is long or deep-draught in strong current, it must go faster than 10 knots."**

Let me know if you'd like to generate the equivalent for `s2` as well, or extend the logic for hazardous cargo vessels.

============= CRITERIA EVALUATION =============
Total points: 8/10

1. Is the syntax correct, so that we can run the proposed Rebeca property, without changes? (Yes=1p, No=0p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 1p

2. Are all relevant attributes included? (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p) (0%-<33%=0p, >=33%-<67%=1p, >=67%-<100%=2p, 100%=3p)
Answer: Partially
Points: 2p

Ship:
ship_length ✅
ship_draught ✅
ship_velocity ✅

theMap:
ship_inside_istanbul_strait ❌
undercurrent ✅

3. Are correctness properties created for all relevant actors? (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor) (All = 2p, deduct 1p for each missing actor)
Answer: Yes
Points: 2p

4. Is the output code free from hallucinations (e.g. any irrelevant code added)? (1p)
Answer: Yes
Points: 1p

5. Is the logic correct? (3p (Correct: 2p, Partially correct: 1p) + (Full expression:1p))
Answer: Corret, Not full expression
Points: 2p

Note: Misses out on checking if vessel is inside the strait or not
