Context: Legata is a domain language that describes abstract legal concepts regarding COLREG (Collision Regulations). In Legata there are various clauses that describe various laws and regulations that vessels must adhere to. These clauses are intended for modeling regulatory compliance and simulation of maritime scenarios.
The structure of a clause is as follows:

clause['NameOfClause']:{
condition: {
: Condition1
: Condition2
}
assure: {
: BooleanExpression
}
}

Timed Rebeca (Reactive Objects Language) is used for modeling and simulating concurrent, reactive systems. The code below is part of a model used to simulate vessels, created in Timed Rebeca in Afra. 
The relevant actors are Ship and MapServer. The acronym VTS means Vessel Traffic Services. The actors are modeled like this:

<ship code>

<MapServer code>

The relevant attributes regarding ship objects and MapServer objects are those:

<Some code>

The property file is constructed like this:
property{
	define {
    Variable = (BooleanExpression);
	}

	Assertion {
        AssertionName: (BooleanExpression);
	}
}

Instruction: In Rebeca syntax, create a property file that represents the law in the Legata clause. We are only interested in Assertions, and not TCTL. After generating the property code, explain the intended semantic meaning of the Legata clause, and how the Legata clause attributes/conditions is mapped to the property variables/attributes. 
Allowed operators: <, >, ==, !, ||, &&, ^.
Do not use expressions like -> or define chained variables in define.
